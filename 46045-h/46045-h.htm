</div>

<p class='c003'>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank Chadwick, strolling along the water-front
in Naples, stopped suddenly in his tracks and gazed
in the direction from whence had come the cry of
distress.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Help! Help!” came the cry again, in English.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank dashed forward toward a dirty-looking
sailors’ boarding house, from the inside of which
he could distinguish the sounds of a struggle.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he sprang through the door, at the far end
of the room he saw a little man in a red sweater,
unmistakably an American, apparently battling for
his life with two swarthy Italians, both armed with
gleaming knives.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank jumped forward with a cry, and as he did
so, the Italians turned and fled. The little American
wiped his face on his sleeve, and then turned to
Frank with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You came just in time,” he declared. “I thought
it was all up with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m glad I did,” replied the lad, grasping the
other’s hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” continued the little man. “If you
hadn’t-a-come, them dagos would-a-done for me
sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He led the way to an adjoining room, Frank following
him. He sat down at a table and rapped
loudly upon it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s have a drink,” he said, as a greasy-looking
Italian in an even more greasy apron entered the
room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” replied Frank; “but I don’t drink.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, come on now,” urged the other; “take something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Frank with finality. “I must go,” he
continued, turning toward the door. “I am glad to
have been of some assistance to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But even as he turned the American in the red
sweater stamped twice upon the floor and a trap
door fell away beneath Frank’s feet. The lad
caught a glimpse of water below.</p>

<p class='c004'>His elbow struck the floor as he went down, and
he fell head-first into a small rowboat. His head
struck the bottom of the boat with sickening force,
stunning him.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was almost an hour later when his wits began
to return to him. He took in the scene around him.
He stood on the deck of a small schooner, and a
great hulk of a man with an evil face stood near
him, arguing with his friend of the red sweater.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is this thing you’ve brought me?” shouted
the big man. “If we don’t look out we’ll step on it
and break it. It hadn’t ought to be around without
its ma.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, he’ll do all right, captain,” replied the red
sweater. “But I’ve got to skip or I’ll have the
patrol boat after me. Do you sign or not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’ll tackle this one, but if he ain’t up to
snuff he’ll come back by freight, and don’t you forget
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The red sweater pocketed a note the captain
handed him, went over the side of the schooner and
rowed off.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank gazed about the schooner. Several dirty
sailors, fully as evil looking as the captain, were
working about the deck. Apparently they were
foreigners. The captain appeared to be an American.</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain, Harwood by name, turned to Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get forward,” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank drew himself up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the meaning of this?” he exclaimed. “I
demand to be put ashore.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that so,” sneered the big captain; “and why
do you suppose I went to all this trouble to get
you here, huh? Now you listen to me. I’m
captain of this here tub, and what I say goes. Get
forward!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Still Frank stood still.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here,” he began, “I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain knocked him down with a single blow
of his great fist, and kicked his prostrate form.
Then he picked him up, caught him by the neck
and the slack of his coat and ran him forward to the
hatchway, and flung him below.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Frank picked himself up there descended upon
him a deluge of clothes, followed by the captain’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s your outfit, Willie, and it won’t cost you
a cent. You’ve got two minutes to get into them,
and I hope you won’t force me to give you any
assistance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank Chadwick was a lad of discretion. Therefore
he made haste to change, and in less than the
allotted time he again emerged on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank had just passed his sixteenth birthday.
Always athletically inclined, he was extremely large
for his age; and his muscles, hardened by much
outdoor exercise, made him a match for many a
man twice his age, as he had proven more than
once when forced to do so.</p>

<p class='c004'>His father was a well-to-do physician in a small
New England town. For a lad of his years, Frank
was an expert in the art of self-defense. Also he
could ride, shoot and fence.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the lad was by no means an expert with
sailing vessels, he nevertheless had had some experience
in that line. At home he had a small
sailboat and in the summer months spent many
hours upon the water. Consequently he was well
versed in nautical terms.</p>

<p class='c004'>This summer Frank and his father had been
touring Europe. The war clouds which had hovered
over the continent for weeks had finally burst
while father and son were in Germany. In getting
out of the country the two had been separated, and
for two days now the lad had been unable to find
Dr. Chadwick.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank was well up on his history, and this, together
with the fact that his mother was of English
descent, turned his sympathies with the allies.
Also he was a student of literature and languages,
and could converse fluently in French, German and
Italian.</p>

<p class='c004'>As has been said, Frank was a lad of discretion;
which is the reason he appeared upon deck again
within the two minutes allowed him by the captain.</p>

<p class='c004'>He emerged from below with blood upon his face
and the grime of an unclean ship upon his hands.
As he came on deck he saw the crew of the schooner
hurrying forward, six of them, Italians every one.
On the quarterdeck stood the captain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look at Willie,” shouted the captain in great
glee. “Clap on to the starboard windlass brake,
son.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank saw the Italians ranged about what he
supposed was the windlass in the bow. He took
his place among them, grasping one of the bars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Break down!” came the next order, and Frank
and the Italians obeyed, bearing up and down on
the bars till the slack of the anchor chain came
home and stretched taut and dripping from the
hawse-holes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“'Vast heavin’!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank released his hold on the brake. Orders
came thick and fast now, and Frank’s experience
with his own sailboat stood him in good stead, and
soon the schooner was beating out to sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wind blew violent and cold, and the spray
was flying like icy small-shot. The schooner rolled
and plunged and heaved and sank and rose again.
Frank was drenched to the skin and sore in every
joint.</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain at length ordered the cook to give
the men their food.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get forward, son,” he commanded, fixing Frank
with his eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank descended below. The Italians were already
there, sitting on the edges of their bunks.
The cook brought in supper, stewed beef and pork.
A liquor that bore a slight resemblance to coffee
was served. This was Black Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” muttered Frank, looking at the mess of
which the Italians were eating hungrily, “I’ve got
to come to it some time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He took his knife from his pocket, opened the
big blade and cut off a piece of pork. This he
forced himself to eat. Then he once more went
on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later the captain emerged from
his cabin. Then he and an Italian he called Charlie,
who, in the absence of a mate, appeared to be the
second in command, began to choose the men for
their watches. Frank found himself in the captain’s
watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I may as well tell you,” he said to the captain,
“that I’m no sailor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you will be, son,” came the reply. “You’ll
either be a sailor or shark bait.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The watches divided, the captain said to Frank:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Son, I’m going to do you a real favor. You
can berth aft in the cabin with Charlie and me,
and you can make free of my quarterdeck. Maybe
you ain’t used to the way of sailormen, but you
can take it from me those are two real concessions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you tell me where we are bound, captain?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll tell you it’s none of your business,” came
the sharp reply. “You do as I say and ask no
questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>About an hour later Frank turned in. The
captain showed him his bunk. It was under the companionway
that led down into the cabin. The captain
bunked on one side and Charlie on the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Frank made his way to his bunk, he saw a
sight that caused him to catch his breath in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a fourth bunk, above the one in which the
captain slept, was the figure of another man. Approaching
closer, Frank saw that the man was
bound and gagged, and apparently unconscious.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hmmm,” he muttered. “Wonder what this
means?”</p>

<p class='c004'>And at his words the occupant of the bunk
moved slightly and moaned.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c002'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />MUTINY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Frank went over to the bunk and peered in. At
that moment Captain Harwood’s voice broke upon
his ear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looking at my little long lost chum, are you,
son?” he said in a low, gentle voice. “Well,” and
his voice grew suddenly harsh, “don’t do it! You
keep away from there! You hear me? You keep
away or I’ll feed you to the little fishes!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He aimed a vicious blow at Frank, which the lad
avoided only by a quick backward leap. The captain
took a step forward as though to continue his
attack; then changed his mind and said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to hurt you, son, but you’ll have
to keep away from my property.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain turned on his heel and went on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of the captain’s warning, Frank once
more approached the man in the bunk; but he kept
a wary eye on the door. Putting his foot on the
edge of the captain’s bunk, he pulled himself up.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bound man was still moaning feebly. Frank
removed the gag from his mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” said the man in a low voice in English.
“I didn’t think I could stand that thing in
my mouth another instant.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter, anyhow,” demanded Frank.
“Why are you kept a prisoner here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a long story,” was the reply, “and I haven’t
time to tell you now. But I can say this much, for
I don’t believe you will repeat it. I’m in the English
diplomatic corps and am on an important mission.
My capture must be the work of treachery.
I suppose I am to be turned over to the Germans.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought diplomacy was a thing of the past,”
said Frank. “Of what use is diplomacy now that
practically the whole of Europe is at war?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s just it,” was the reply. “The whole of
Europe is not at war. Italy is still neutral, but
unless something happens she is likely to throw in
her fortunes with Germany.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what have you got to do with that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man in the bunk was silent for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All I can say,” he replied finally, “is that I am
supposed to see that something happens; or rather,
I should say, I am to help.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how did you get here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was trapped. There is a traitor somewhere.
It looks as though I am done for. The Germans
know me. They will show me no mercy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely, it’s not as bad as all that!” exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Worse, if possible,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I can’t believe Captain Harwood, an American,
would be engaged in work of that sort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Harwood!” exclaimed, the man in the bunk. “A
more villainous pirate never lived. I know him of
old. I don’t know how he happened to be sailing
at this exact time. He certainly is not making
this trip on my account alone. He’s up to some
other game.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank was struck with an idea.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But the crew,” he exclaimed. “Can’t we get
some help from them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you bank on that,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But&mdash;&mdash;” began Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man in the bunk interrupted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sh-h-h!” he cautioned. “Footsteps!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank listened a moment; then with a quick
spring jumped into his own bunk just as Captain
Harwood again appeared. The captain approached
him. To all appearances Frank was sleeping
soundly. The captain grunted and then approached
the man in the bunk.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So!” he exclaimed. “I’ve got you again, eh!
Well, this time you won’t get away. You don’t
think I’ve forgotten I spent two years behind the
bars on your account, do you? I haven’t. You
hear me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He struck the helpless man a blow with his fist.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why don’t you answer me?” he demanded; then
smiled to himself. “Oh, I forgot. Guess I’ll remove
that gag and let you say something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He climbed up and leaned over the occupant of
the upper bunk, then started back with a cry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did you remove that gag?” he demanded;
then continued, “O-ho I see. Little Willie boy, eh!
Well&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned toward Frank and at the same moment
the man in the bunk let out a cry of warning.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Frank was not to be caught napping. As
the captain turned toward him he sprang to his
feet and placed himself in an attitude of defense.
He knew that he was no match for the giant captain,
but he determined to give a good account of
himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well,” cried the captain advancing, “little
Willie is going to fight! What d’ye think o’ that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He doubled his huge fists and took another step
forward; but at that instant there came a fearful
cry from on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain paused, and Charlie’s voice came
down the hatchway in a loud wail:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Help!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Harwood sprang toward the door, and
as he went through it he hurled back over his
shoulder:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll 'tend to your case when I come back, son!”</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later there came cries from above and
the sound of a furious struggle. Frank rushed up
the hatchway to the deck, where a terrible sight
met his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Surrounded by all six of the crew. Captain Harwood
was battling desperately for his life. Time
after time he struck out with his great fists, but
his blows failed to land. The nimble Italians
skipped back, then closed in again. By the wheel,
Frank saw the unconscious form of Charlie.</p>

<p class='c004'>Long, wicked-looking knives gleamed in the hands
of the Italians. Bleeding from half a dozen
wounds, the giant captain continued to fight off his
enemies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Frank. “I can’t stand
here and see him killed!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sprang forward and, before his presence was
noted, struck down one of the Italians with a blow
of his fist.</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain noted with a nod this aid from such
an unexpected source.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good work, son!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank turned to another of the Italians, but as he
did so the man he had knocked down arose, stooped
and picked up a belaying pin that lay nearby, and
struck Frank a heavy blow on the head.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad dropped to the deck unconscious. At
the same moment the other Italians sprang upon
the captain with even greater ferocity. In vain he
tried to fight them off. Two he knocked down with
hammer-like blows of his great fists. Then, seizing
a descending arm, he twisted sharply and a knife
fell clattering to the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the same moment another Italian sprang upon
his unprotected back, and buried his knife to the
hilt. Three times the captain spun around on his
heel, then fell to the deck on his face. Instantly
half a dozen knives were buried in his back. The
captain gave a great sob, shuddered, and lay still.</p>

<p class='c004'>Roughly the Italians picked up the great body,
carried it to the rail and threw it into the sea. The
body of Charlie was treated in a similar manner.
Then the Italians approached Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they picked him up he groaned. Consciousness
was returning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s still alive,” came a voice. “What shall we
do with him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Overboard with him anyhow,” came the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said another voice. “Let him live. Tie
him up and put him below with the other prisoner.
There is a good price on the head of one, according
to what the captain said. The other may be worth
something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was now dark; but suddenly the little schooner
was the center of a dazzling light and a shot rang
out over the water. Dimly, could be made out the
outlines of a battle cruiser. A second shot rang
out&mdash;a command to heave-to.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quick!” cried one of the mutineers, apparently
the leader of the gang. “We must make a run for
it. Tie this dog up and throw him below!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Swiftly Frank was bound hand and foot and
tumbled down the hatchway. In falling the knot
that bound his feet became unloosened and he freed
his legs with little difficulty. But try as he would
he could not release his hands. He made his way
to his bunk and lay down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter?” came the voice of the man
in the bunk.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank explained matters to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” was the reply. “They can’t get away
from the cruiser. It is undoubtedly a British ship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But both were doomed to disappointment. A
heavy wind had sprung up and now was blowing a
gale. With all sails set, the little schooner soon
lost itself in the darkness, and when morning
dawned there was not the sign of a sail as far as
the eye could see.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />JACK TEMPLETON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Jack Templeton stood in a shady grove in a
little hamlet on the north coast of Africa. A lad
of seventeen, he was the only white person in the
village, or in fact for many miles around. He had
come there with his father five years before.</p>

<p class='c004'>His father’s reasons for thus practically burying
himself alive, Jack did not know. He had started
up a little store and had made a bare living selling
goods to the natives. Twice a year a ship brought
him stock enough for the ensuing six months, but
except at these rare intervals, a white man was
seldom seen in the village.</p>

<p class='c004'>A year before Jack’s father had died, and Jack
had inherited the little store. Now he was following
in his father’s footsteps. Of his father’s past
life he knew next to nothing, beyond the fact that
his father, by birth, was an Englishman, and, before
coming to the little African village, had lived
for some years in the United States.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of his youth, Jack was of huge stature.
Always tall for his age, he had filled out so rapidly
that now at seventeen he was well over six feet
and big all through. His strength was immense,
and there were no three natives in the village that
could stand up against him.</p>

<p class='c004'>His father had been a scholar, and Jack was a
keen student. He spoke several languages besides
English and one or two native dialects.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Jack stood in the little grove this warm afternoon
he kept an attentive eye on a shabby looking
schooner that was creeping up from the south. At
a distance of about a mile from the shore the
schooner luffed up, hoisted a dirty red ensign and
dropped her anchor; a fishing canoe, which had paddled
out to meet her, ran alongside and presently
returned shoreward with a couple of strangers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack made no move, in spite of the fact that he
was well aware that the strangers, probably, were
headed direct for his store. To-day he was in no
mood to meet a white man, for he was not quite
ready to take his departure from the village.</p>

<p class='c004'>The canoe landed, the strangers stepped ashore
and disappeared. Presently a file of natives appeared
moving toward the shore, each carrying a
large basket of provisions. Then suddenly two
white men appeared, running.</p>

<p class='c004'>They jumped in the canoe, the men pushed off
and the little craft began to wriggle its way through
the surf. At the same moment another figure
appeared on the beach, and made unmistakable signs
of hostility to the receding canoe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack recognized this figure. It was his assistant.
As Jack crossed the sand toward the village, the
black assistant came running toward him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dem sailors am tiefs, sar!” he gasped, when
he had come within earshot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack comprehended in a moment. “Do you mean
they didn’t pay you?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sar! No, sar!” exclaimed the assistant excitedly.
“Dey no pay nuttin’.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” said Jack calmly. “We’ll go aboard
and collect for it then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All canoes out fishin’ 'cept dat one,” exclaimed
the negro, pointing to the one carrying the sailors
back to the schooner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll wait for that one, then,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two sat down on the beach to wait. The
negro said nothing. He knew Jack too well to try
and dissuade him from his purpose, so he kept his
own counsel.</p>

<p class='c004'>The canoe ran alongside the schooner, and having
discharged its passengers and freight, put off
for its return to shore. Then the schooner’s sails
began to slide up the stays; the canvas aloft began
to flatten out to the pull of the sheets. The schooner
was preparing to get under way.</p>

<p class='c004'>The canoe had now reached the beach and Jack
and the black assistant climbed in. Then they put
off toward the schooner.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the canoe bounded forward, Jack suddenly
caught the sound of the schooner’s windlass pawl.
The anchor was being hove up.</p>

<p class='c004'>The natives in the canoe bent to the work. The
canoe swept alongside the schooner and Jack, grasping
a chain, swung himself up into the channel,
whence he climbed to the bulwark rail and dropped
down on the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>The windlass was manned by five men, plainly
Italians. A sixth was seated on the deck nearby.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good afternoon,” said Jack. “You forgot to
pay for those provisions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The seated man looked up with a start, first at
Jack, then at the assistant, who now sat astride the
rail, ready either to advance or retreat. The clink
of the windlass ceased and the other five men came
aft grinning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you doing aboard this ship?” demanded
the seated sailor in halting and very poor
English.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve come to collect my dues,” replied Jack.
“I’m the owner of these provisions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are mistaken,” said the sailor. “I am the
owner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you have got to pay me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here,” remarked the sailor, rising. “You
get overboard quick!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want my pay,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pitch him overboard,” spoke up another sailor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first sailor, evidently the commander, advanced.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack stood motionless with his long legs wide
apart, his hands clasped behind him, his shoulders
hunched up and his chin thrust forward. He presented
an uninviting aspect.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sailor evidently appreciated this, and for a
moment hesitated. Then he came forward again.
But he picked a bad moment for his attack, for he
rushed just as the deck rose.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a resounding “smack, smack,” the
sailor staggered backward, upsetting two men behind
him, staggered down the deck closely followed
by Jack, and finally fell sprawling in the scuppers
with his head jammed against the stanchion.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two other men scrambled to their feet and,
with their three companions, closed in on Jack;
but the latter did not wait to be attacked.</p>

<p class='c004'>He charged the group, hammering right and left,
regardless of the thumps he got in return, and gradually
drove them, bewildered by his quickness and
heavy blows, through the space between the foremast
and the bulwark.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly they backed away before his battering,
hampered by their numbers as they struck at him,
until one man, who had the bad luck to catch two
uppercuts in succession, whipped out his sheath
knife.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack’s quick eye caught the glint of the steel just
as he was passing the fife rail. He whipped out
an iron belaying pin and brought it down on the
man’s head. The man dropped, and as the belaying
pin rose and fell, the other men drew back.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly a shot rang out. A little cloud of splinters
flew from the mast near Jack’s head. Glancing
forward. Jack beheld the leader emerge from the
forecastle hatch and aim at him with a revolver.
At that moment Jack was abreast of the uncovered
main hatch. He had perceived a tier of grain bags
covering the floor of the hold. He stooped, and
with his hands on the coaming, vaulted over,
dropped on the bags, picked himself up and scrambled
forward under the shelter of the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hold of the ship was a single cavity. The
forward part contained a portion of the outward
cargo, while the homeward lading was stowed abaft
the main hatch. There was plenty of room to move
about.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a moment after Jack dropped to this place of
temporary refuge the air was thick with imprecations
and the sound of angry stamping came to
Jack’s ears. Hardly had he squeezed himself behind
the stack of bales when a succession of shots
rang out.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then there was a pause, and soon the leader
commanded one of his men to follow Jack. The man
demurred. None of the others would go after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s too handy with that belaying pin,” observed
one.</p>

<p class='c004'>One man was struck with a brilliant idea.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bottle him up,” he cried. “Clap on the hatch
covers and batten down. Then we have him and
can sleep in our bunks in peace.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” exclaimed the leader.</p>

<p class='c004'>This plan seemed to satisfy all parties, and a
general movement warned Jack that his incarceration
was imminent. For a moment he was disposed
to make a last desperate sortie, but the certainty
that he would be killed before he reached the
deck decided him to lie low.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hatch covers dropped into their beds. Then
Jack heard the tarpaulin dragged over the hatch,
shutting out the last gleams of light that had filtered
through joints of the covers; the battens were
dropped into the catches, the wedges driven home.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack sat in a darkness like that of the tomb.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c002'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />FRANK MAKES A FRIEND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was clear to Jack that this was no place to
stay if he could help it. From the first it had been
evident to him that there was something wrong
about the ship. Apart from the lawless behavior
of the crew, there was the fact that since he had
come on board he had seen no vestige of an officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sailor who had first attacked him seemed to
have some sort of authority. Jack naturally came
to the conclusion that he was in command of the
vessel. There was only one reasonable answer,
which was confirmed by a certain brown stain Jack
had noticed on the deck. There had been a mutiny
on the ship.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack struck a match. The flame lighted up the
corner into which he had crept and he saw several
objects that he had not noticed before, a shipwright’s
auger, a calking mallet and probably a
dozen wooden pegs, tapering at one end.</p>

<p class='c004'>The purpose of these was unmistakable. The
sailors intended to scuttle the ship. Holes were to
be bored in the bottom and the plugs driven into
them. Then, when the mutineers were ready to
leave, the ship would be abandoned with the water
pouring into her hold.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tools suggested an idea to Jack. He picked
up the auger and mallet and groped his way aft.
He climbed up on the pile of sacks and crawled
along until he came to the bulkhead that separated
the cabin from the hold. He set the point of the
auger against the bulkhead, and grasping the cross
lever, set to work vigorously. He was soon rewarded
by feeling the tool give with a jerk, and
when he withdrew it there was a circular hole,
through which daylight streamed faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack put one eye to the hole and peered through.
He could make out several objects in the cabin
beyond. Having made this brief survey, he returned
to his task. Above the hole he had already bored,
he bored another slightly intersecting it, above this
another, and so on, tracing a continuous row of
holes, each encroaching on the next, in a wide circle.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the time he had drilled the thirtieth hole, the
weakening light filtering through told him the sun
was setting. The fortieth hole was within an inch
of the first one bored. Jack gave a vigorous kick
on the space inclosed by the line of holes, and
sent the oval piece of plank flying into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>He slipped easily through the opening and groped
about the cabin. He felt his way to the companion
ladder, where he bumped against a bunk. He
sprawled headlong, and beneath his fingers felt a
human form. He sprang back and struck a match.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before him he saw the face of a boy, and he
again approached the bunk. The lad’s hands were
bound and he was sleeping. Jack shook him, and
the boy looked up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hello,” he said. “What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rather, what are you doing here?” was Jack’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m Frank Chadwick, an American,” was the
answer. “Untie my hands and I’ll tell you all about
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack did as he was requested, and then Frank
motioned toward the upper bunk just across from
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll perform the same operation there, and
then we’ll have a talk,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack approached the bunk indicated, and perceived
a second bound form. Quickly the two lads
untied him, and the man slid to the floor and
stretched himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” he said, rubbing his hands. “I’m glad
to get out of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s this all about, anyhow?” demanded Jack,
in great surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank gave an account of his adventures after
meeting the little American with the red sweater
in Naples. Then the man who had been tied in
the bunk repeated the story he had told Frank
when the lad had first entered the cabin, adding
that his name was Albert Hetherington.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how do you come to be here?” he demanded
of Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack explained.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” exclaimed Hetherington, “you have put
your head into a hornet’s nest, young man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Jack, “and I’m going to keep it
there until I’m paid to take it out. I want two
pounds four and I’m going to get it before I leave
this ship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack climbed up on a small table, and wrapping
his hand in his handkerchief, crashed his fist through
the skylight. The skylight had a fixed top, and,
instead of the usual guard bars, had loose wooden
shutters for use in bad weather. Jack picked away
the remainder of the glass. Placing a small box
on top of the table, he climbed upon it and peered
out.</p>

<p class='c004'>He could just catch a glimpse of the man at the
wheel. The fellow was not taking his duties very
seriously, for he was sitting on the grating filling
his pipe and letting the ship steer itself. Jack considered,
looked out again, then descended from the
table with a distinctly purposeful air.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m looking for a piece of rubber plaster,” he
told Frank and Hetherington.</p>

<p class='c004'>He opened the medicine chest, and cut off
several strips. Then he picked up a piece of rope
that hung upon a peg on the cabin wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want to try a little experiment,” he told the
others. “I’ll tell you about it later.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He cut off a couple of lengths of rope, and having
pocketed one, and having made a small fixed
loop in the end of the other, climbed up on the box
again and looked out on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>All was quiet without. Jack heard the helmsman
yawn sleepily; he had left the wheel with a rope
hitched around one of the spokes, and was now
leaning over the rail looking at the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>Grasping the frame of the skylight, Jack gave a
light spring and came stealthily through the opening.
Then, creeping along the deck in the shelter
of the small boat and the companion hood, he stole
toward the sailor.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the man threw back his head and yawned,
Jack slipped his left hand around, holding the strip
of plaster spread out on it, and clapped the plaster
over the man’s mouth, and instantly pinioned his
hands by clasping him tightly round the chest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man struggled furiously and would have
shouted, but was only able to grunt and snort, so
well had the plaster done its work. The struggle
went on with little noise. Jack contrived to pass
the end of the line through the loop and draw it
until it was ready for a final pull. Then he hurled
the man to the deck, jerked the line tight and sat
on the prisoner’s legs. He bound him tightly and
then sat quiet a moment, listening.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally he arose and slid his helpless prisoner
through the skylight into the cabin and then lowered
himself by the way he had emerged.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here he seized the captive, dragged him across
the cabin, and thrust him through the bulkhead,
followed him through and removed the plaster from
the man’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” he said to his prisoner, “if you know
what is good for you, you will keep quiet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Evidently the man knew. He signified his intention
of keeping quiet, and Jack returned to the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, that’s one of them out of the way,” he
told his new friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Hetherington, “but there are five
or six more up there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Five,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll see what can be done,” remarked Jack,
and again climbed on the table and peered forth
from the skylight.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now there was no one to capture. The
wheel jerked to and fro in its lashings. Suddenly
the vessel heeled over crazily. At the same time a
voice called:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter, Pedro? You’ll have the
masts overboard if you don’t look out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later the leader of the mutineers came
staggering aft, followed by several of his men. He
gazed at the wheel in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where has he gone?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Down in the cabin, I guess,” said one of the
men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” was the reply, “the companion is fastened
up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s gone overboard, that’s where he’s gone,”
said another voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess you’re right,” replied the leader. “Here,
Antonio, you mind the helm, and don’t you go overboard,
too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Muttering sleepily, another man took his place
at the wheel, and the others moved off. Jack bent
down from the table and whispered to the others.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now is the time to get the next one. You two
stand by and take care of him when I pass him
along to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better be careful,” said Frank. “They are all
liable to jump you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack did not reply. He pulled himself up and
dropped to the deck.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c002'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />FREE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>From the direction of the wheel there came a loud
snore. The sailor had deliberately seated himself
upon the deck in a comfortable position.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack stole up to the sleeping seaman and softly
encircled his arms with the noose. Then he passed
the lashing around his ankles and tied them firmly.
This aroused the sleeper, who began to mumble protests.
Instantly Jack slapped the plaster over his
mouth. Then he dragged the man to the skylight
and tumbled him down unceremoniously, and followed
him into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Hetherington held him while Jack removed
the plaster and thrust him through the hole
in the bulkhead. Just as Jack once more put his
head through the skylight, there was the sound of a
voice and Jack drew inside.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something queer on this ship, I tell you,” declared
the leader. “First Pedro goes overboard and
then Antonio follows him. Sebastian, you take the
wheel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not me,” came the reply. “I’m not going overboard
if I can help it. Take the wheel yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither am I,” declared another voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>A wrangle followed, with the result that the
leader was forced to take the wheel. Looking out
again, Jack saw that the man was peering out over
the water. Softly he again dropped to the deck,
and stole upon the unsuspecting leader.</p>

<p class='c004'>A fierce struggle ensued. The Italian was a big
man, and in spite of Jack’s strength and size, he
put up a furious battle. The two rolled against the
rail, there was a sharp crack and with a loud cry
the leader suddenly went overboard. Jack jumped
back to the skylight and crouched down; and it was
not a moment too soon.</p>

<p class='c004'>The other three men approached.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s gone all right,” said one, gazing at the
spot where the leader had stood a moment before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, he’s gone,” said another. “I guess it will
be our turn next.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly a cry from the water drew their attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s Ferdinand,” said one of the sailors, “and
he is swimming.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s to be done?” demanded another. “We
can’t let him drown like that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” replied another. “Francisco and I will get
out the boat and pull him in. You stay here,” turning
to the third man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” came the reply. “Stay here by myself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You do as I say. We have got to get Ferdinand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Jack was struck with an idea. He was
well aware of the superstitious nature of sailors,
and he planned to play upon it. He descended to
the cabin and from the wall took a suit of the
captain’s oilskins. Then he went back on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two of the men had gone over the side in the
small boat, and the remaining sailor was now engaged
in hanging a lamp from the stern. Jack
silently approached him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having secured the lamp, the sailor took a long
look out over the sea and then turned toward the
deck; and as his eyes fell on the tall, oil-skinned
figure, he uttered a gasp of horror, and began to
shuffle backward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The captain’s ghost!” he exclaimed in an awed
voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the sailor’s heels caught on a ringbolt
and he staggered and fell on the deck with a howl
of terror; but in another instant he had scrambled
to his feet and rushed away forward, whence the
slam of the forecastle scuttle announced his retirement
to a place of safety.</p>

<p class='c004'>More than half an hour elapsed before a hoarse
hail from the sea heralded the return of the boat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is all well?” came the cry. “Ferdinand is gone.
We couldn’t find him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack stepped back into the shadow of the mainsail.
Soon the heads of the two men appeared over
the rail, and they swung themselves to the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>For one instant they stood as if petrified; then,
with one accord, they stampeded forward, and once
more the forecastle scuttle slammed. Jack followed,
and, quietly thrusting a belaying pin through the
staple of the scuttle, secured them in their retreat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mutiny was a thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Jack made his way to the cabin, where he
informed his two newly-made friends of the success
of his endeavors, and the three went on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re all right,” Frank told Jack in great admiration,
as the three gazed out over the water. “I
had given up all hope of getting away alive. I don’t
see how you ever managed it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nor I,” said Hetherington. “I know Frank and
I couldn’t have done it together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack laughed modestly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A little thinking is all that’s necessary,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you are quite a thinker,” said Frank; “but
it strikes me you are something of a fighter besides.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What shall we do now?” broke in Hetherington.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose I had better get home,” replied Jack.
“Besides, we are not far from there. You had both
better come with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want to get back to Naples,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I must get to Nalut, Tripoli, at the earliest
possible moment,” declared Hetherington.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nalut!” exclaimed Jack. “Why, we can’t be far
from there now. It’s close to my home. I have
been there several times.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t mean it,” cried Hetherington. “Then
I can get there from your place?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Easily, by camel. It is about a day’s journey.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hetherington turned to Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why can’t you come with me?” he asked. “I’ll
look after you. I expect to be back in England in
a couple of weeks, and you can go with me. Then
you can return to the United States.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I wanted to get back to Naples and try and
find my father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You probably wouldn’t be able to find him now.
The chances are he has returned home himself, hoping
to find you there, as he has been unable to find
you in more than a week.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess you are right,” replied Frank. “I’ll go
with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was late the next afternoon when the schooner
once more drew near the little African town in
which Jack lived, and dropped anchor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack called the prisoners from below.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know why I should bother with you,” he
said. “I know you are mutineers and should be
dealt with severely, but I am not an executioner.
Pay me my two pounds four,” he continued, turning
to one of the men, “and we shall leave the ship. It’s
not my ship and neither is it yours; but you can
have it as far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Frank. “We don’t need it any
longer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the Italians ran hurriedly below. Returning
he placed two bags of gold in Jack’s hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take this, <i>signor</i>,” he exclaimed. “We will have
no luck unless we give you this gold.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” replied Jack, “all I want is what is due
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, yes; you must take it, <i>signor</i>,” cried all the
Italians.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack thrust his hand into one of the canvas bags
and brought out a handful of coins, from which he
selected two. The others he returned to the bag,
adding to them a couple of coins from his own
pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two shillings change,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c004'>He threw the bags down on deck and dropped
himself into the small boat now lying alongside.
The other two followed him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But he had hardly taken his seat when two heavy
thumps on the floor of the boat, followed by a jingling
impact, announced the arrival of the two bags
of gold.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must take the gold, <i>signor</i>. You must take
it, else we shall have no luck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack stood up in the boat. Frank and Hetherington
pulled on the oars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pull,” Jack commanded, and the boat started
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Aiming skillfully at the open gangway, Jack sent
the heavy bags, one after the other, skimming
along the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the Italians grabbed them up and rushed
to the gangway. But he was too late. The boat
was twenty yards away, and leaping forward beneath
the strokes of Frank and Hetherington.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c002'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />THE SECRET AGENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Upon landing the three made their way at once
to Jack’s small home, a rudely constructed native
hut.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sorry I haven’t a better place to offer you,” said
Jack, “but I guess you can put up with it for one
day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No apology is needed,” said Hetherington.
“This is plenty good enough for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And for me,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, just make yourselves at home, then,” said
Jack. “I’ll see if I can’t scare up something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Their appetites appeased, Frank bethought himself
of Hetherington’s promise to tell him his story,
and reminded him of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hetherington hesitated a moment, and then said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know as there is any reason I shouldn’t
tell you, particularly as I undoubtedly owe my life
to you both. In the first place, I am what is known
as a secret agent of the British government.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A what?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A secret agent; in other words, a diplomatic
agent, though I am not officially recognized as such.
Which means, that in the event of anything happening
to me, England could not be held responsible for
my actions, nor could I look to my government for
aid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see what you mean,” said Frank, and Jack
nodded his head in assent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean that what you do, although under instructions,
you do at your own risk?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. For instance, if, in some diplomatic undertaking,
I should be apprehended upon the order
of a foreign government, say as a spy, or for some
overt political act, my government would not countenance
my action, even though I am acting under
direct orders.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must be dangerous work,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You take your life in your hands every time you
are sent upon a mission,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hetherington smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Practically that,” he admitted. “It’s dangerous
work, no doubt; but there is a spice of excitement to
it that makes it worth while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Besides which, someone has to do the work, I
suppose,” suggested Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Precisely. Every one of the great powers has its
set of secret agents. The peace of Europe has been
saved more than once by these men. The game goes
on daily, and our safety depends entirely upon our
keeping our identity secret. More than one man has
disappeared, never to be heard of again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t mean that they were assassinated?”
demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly; nine times out of ten, when a secret
agent is caught, his life pays the forfeit. Sounds
barbarous, doesn’t it?” and Hetherington smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It certainly does,” replied Frank. “I thought
the days of barbarism had passed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, to tell the truth, England and France have
given up such practice. Germany, Austria, and even
Russia, in some cases, continue the old custom. So
you may see why the life of a secret agent is not all
roses.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should say no roses at all,” declared Jack. “But
go on with your story.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Hetherington, “the situation is this,
but,” and the speaker paused, “in case you haven’t
political conditions in Europe at your finger-tips, I
guess I had better explain how the great European
powers are lined up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Germany, Austria and Italy, some years ago,
formed what is now known as the Triple Alliance.
This alliance sets forth that in case either country
that signed the agreement is attacked by a hostile
power, the other two members of the alliance are
bound to support it. Although a natural enemy of
Austria, Italy nevertheless was in some manner inveigled
into the agreement, practically against her
will. There is no doubt that in the days since the
alliance was formed, she has been used as a cat’spaw
by Germany. Now Italy is beginning to realize it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To offset the Triple Alliance and maintain the
balance of power in Europe, England, France and
Russia, a few years later, entered into a pact and
the alignment of these three countries is known as
the Triple Entente. While not bound to support
each other in case of war, there never was any
doubt that each would do so should the other be
attacked. It was this knowledge that held the Kaiser’s
warlike spirit in check until a few days ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, in spite of the fact that Italy has begun to
realize she is being used as a cat’spaw by Germany,
and also in spite of the natural Italian antagonism
toward Austria, Germany’s other ally, it will take
more than this to keep Italy from joining her allies
in the war. She is in honor bound to support the
alliance, and she will, unless she can be made to
believe that Germany, in secret conjunction with
Austria, is plotting her downfall. And it is this
that Italy must be made to believe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But is that exactly fair?” Frank wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“'All’s fair in love and war,’” quoted Hetherington.
“Besides, we have learned enough through
secret channels to know that it is true. Now we
must make Italy see it without suspecting that we
have had a hand in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like quite a sizable job,” remarked Jack
dryly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And so it is,” was the reply; “which is the reason
I must be in Nalut as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surely you don’t expect to accomplish all this by
yourself?” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, indeed,” replied Hetherington. “But I must
do my part. The plans have all been laid, and day
after to-morrow is the one set upon which to act.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But the thing I can’t see,” Jack broke in, “is why
it is necessary to come to Africa to carry out the
plans.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it’s like this,” said the secret agent. “Suppose
it became quite plain to Italy that Germany was
aiding the Arabs in Tripoli to get up another serious
insurrection against the Italian army&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But she’s not,” broke in Frank. “She has her
hands too full elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who said she was?” demanded Hetherington.
“But suppose old Francisco Dellaya, the great Italian
diplomat, recognized as the foremost of all the
diplomats in Europe, should come upon Abu ben
Sedar, who has led more than one uprising against
Italy, in Nalut, hobnobbing with a bearded man who
presumably is in the Austrian or German army?
Suppose he sees them about together once or twice?
What do you suppose he’d think?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see what you mean,” declared Frank. “But
surely that would not be enough to satisfy him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; the plot goes deeper than that. But suppose,
again, that he learned that Abu ben Sedar had
been furnished with several thousand rifles of unmistakable
German make, and that they had been delivered
by a German vessel straight from Hamburg.
Also a few machine guns. And suppose a hundred
thousand freshly minted German and Austrian silver
marks should be distributed to every hostile
Arab in Tripoli? And suppose old Dellaya got wind
of this? Do you see what I mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This together with the fact that Dellaya had
seen what he supposed was a German or Austrian
officer pretty thick with Abu ben Sedar, would convince
Dellaya that Germany and Austria were putting
up some kind of a game on Italy,” continued
the secret agent. “He would, without doubt, have
the sheik followed, and we would see that he got
plenty of evidence. Then would came a hurry call
to his home government. And the next step would
be that Italy, already only lukewarm toward the
Triple Alliance, would withdraw its support, leaving
Germany and Austria in the lurch. Do I make
myself clear?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But is the Italian diplomat in Tripoli?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” replied the secret agent, “but he will be
day after to-morrow. Once a year he takes a
cruise as the guest of Lord Hastings, apparently a
wealthy English gentleman, but in reality a member
of the British secret service. He has made many
trips to Tripoli, and knows probably every Arab
sheik within a hundred miles. All this was counted
upon when we laid our plans. Oh, he will be there,
all right, and he will see just what we have planned
for him to see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how does it come that you were captured in
Naples by Captain Harwood?” Frank demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was just making my way to the ship on which
I had engaged passage when I was set upon by
three men, apparently Germans. I was overcome
and carried aboard the ship, where you found me.
That’s all I know about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think your mission was suspected?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid so. I fear we have been harboring
a traitor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “it’s getting late. I guess we
would better turn in. We must get an early start
in the morning.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c002'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />ON THE JOURNEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The sun had not yet risen in the east when the
three friends arose. Jack prepared a hasty breakfast,
after which he fared forth to see about obtaining
camels for the journey. He was successful in
his quest, and the edge of the sun creeping over the
horizon could just be seen when they prepared to
mount.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank climbed upon the kneeling camel with no
little trepidation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know anything about camel riding,” he
called to the others.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just hold tight when he gets up and you will be
all right,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank took a firm hold in accordance with instructions,
and it was well that he did so, for otherwise
he would have been sent tumbling over the animal’s
head.</p>

<p class='c004'>The camel rose on its hind feet first, and Frank
was hurled forward on his back. Just as he succeeded
in grasping the camel about the neck, the
animal lifted his front feet and Frank went hurling
back again. Only his tight hold saved him from
being thrown.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” he ejaculated. “This is worse
than a sea voyage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are all right now,” called Hetherington
from the back of his own camel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will soon get used to it,” declared Jack.
“Come, follow me,” and he headed his camel toward
the west.</p>

<p class='c004'>All morning they rode along without interruption.
Several times they passed riders going in the opposite
direction, but they did not halt. At noon they
stopped in a little grove of trees, where they ate of
the provisions Jack had packed on the camels and
quenched their thirst from a tiny and sparkling
stream. Then they continued their journey.</p>

<p class='c004'>Darkness had fallen when they made out in the
distance the little town of Nalut. The camels now
quickened their pace and the little cavalcade was
soon within the city.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first thing to do,” said Hetherington, “is to
find a place to put up for the night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know of a place I believe we can find shelter,”
said Jack, leading the way.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently they came upon a fairly large house
near the center of the town. Jack went up to the
door and knocked loudly. An old man, with snowy
white hair, answered the knock.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack,” he cried in English, when he caught sight
of the lad in the doorway. “What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I came with a couple of friends,” Jack replied,
“and we are looking for a place to spend the night.
Can you accommodate us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly,” was the reply. “Come right in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The three entered the house and followed the old
man to what appeared a small dining-room. There
their host left them, saying that he would have
something to eat brought them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s about the only white man in the town,”
Jack explained. “He has lived here for many years.
As you see, his house is unlike the native dwellings.
He keeps up European customs as well as he can.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon the old man returned, followed by a native
servant, bearing food. The three ate hungrily, and
immediately their appetites were satisfied followed
the old man upstairs, where he showed them a
couple of cots. They turned in immediately and
soon were fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you to meet your companions?”
Frank asked the secret agent, when they had breakfasted
the next morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No particular spot was designated,” was the
reply. “I was told to meet them in this town, that’s
all. I suppose I shall run into them in the street
some place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The three walked about the streets all morning,
and were just about to return to the house where
they had spent the night, when a white man in
yachting costume approached.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hetherington rushed up to him with outstretched
hand. Frank and Jack stood back.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hetherington and the stranger remained in conversation
for some moments, and then approached
the two lads.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is Lieutenant Edwards,” introduced Hetherington.
“Lieutenant, Frank Chadwick and Jack
Templeton.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pleased to meet you, I’m sure,” greeted the lieutenant,
extending a hand, which both boys grasped
in turn. “Hetherington has told me of what assistance
you have been to him. Let me add my thanks
to his.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are Lord Hastings and the rest of the
party?” demanded Hetherington of the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant glanced at the boys quickly, a
question in his eyes. Hetherington noted the look.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, they are all right,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the lieutenant. “Lord Hastings and
Dellaya will be along to-morrow. The others were
delayed in some unaccountable manner, so we shall
have to work without them; and quickly, too,” he
added.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But the arms and ammunition?” cried Hetherington
in alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, that part is all right. The ship will land
the arms and ammunition at a point already selected
in the Gulf of Sidra day after to-morrow. Also
the money is ready. We must do our part in the
meantime.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But if Dellaya sees me with the sheik he will
know me in a minute,” protested Hetherington.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know it; therefore I shall have to play the part
of the German officer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But he knows you also.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True; but I shall be disguised. I have such a
disguise as I am sure he will never penetrate. But
I fear that he will know you the moment he lays
eyes on you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no doubt about that. What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess you will have to remain behind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At this moment Jack broke into the conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t I take his place?” he asked. “He won’t
know me, that’s sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By Jove!” declared Hetherington. “I believe
you can. What do you say, Edwards?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant hesitated.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack noted his uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can give a good account of myself if it comes
to a fight,” he declared. “Besides, I’m English and
should be allowed to do something for my country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you speak German?” asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Jack; “also a few native dialects.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess I can use you, then,” was the response.
“I certainly need someone with me. I have a disguise
that will do for you, too, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how about me?” Frank demanded suddenly.
“Don’t I get a part in this thing? It seems to me
I should be allowed to take a hand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I won’t need you in this first trick,” declared
the lieutenant, “but if I do need you, you can
take my word that I shall call on you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And with this Frank was forced to be content.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack accompanied the two Englishmen
to a place where the lieutenant had stowed a small
suitcase. From this the Englishman drew out two
suits of clothes, which he and Jack donned hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wearing heavy black beards and spectacles, shoes,
hats and clothes of unmistakable German appearance,
there was no question that the two would pass
for Teutons anywhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now to find Abu ben Sedar. And in the meantime,”
he continued, turning to Frank and Hetherington,
“you two make your way to Lord Hastings’
yacht and wait there until I arrive. It would not
do for us to be seen together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gave them the directions and the two departed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now for Abu ben Sedar,” said the lieutenant.
“We must learn where he can be found.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon inquiry they learned that the Sheik was
encamped with many of his followers a few miles
from the outskirts of the town.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the lieutenant, “we’ll have to hunt
him up. The sooner we find him the better. Now,
listen,” turning to Jack, “you say nothing unless I
ask a question, and, whatever I say, agree with me.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. Now how are we to find the place where
the Sheik is encamped, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have been here before,” answered Jack. “I
know the place well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, then; let us go,” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two turned their faces toward the desert and
set off at a brisk pace.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />SETTING THE TRAP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Several hours later Jack and Lieutenant Edwards
were taking coffee with the Sheik on a priceless
rug before his tent in the desert. The lieutenant
was too familiar with Arab customs to come to
the object of his visit at once, so it was late in the
afternoon when he finally brought up the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sheik, what is the present attitude of your people
toward the Italian aggressors?” he asked at
length.</p>

<p class='c004'>Abu ben Sedar was wary.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why do you ask that?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” explained the lieutenant, “I know that
you have led more than one uprising, and I know
the Arab nature too well to think they will kiss the
hand that strikes them down. The spirit of the
desert will rise again. Even now I have heard
rumors&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>“'Tis as you say,” exclaimed the Sheik excitedly,
springing to his feet. “We shall never submit to
Italian rule. They have treated us like dogs. But
we are biding our time. We need rifles, ammunition,
money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that is why I have sought you out,” declared
the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean you have come to help us shake off
the yoke of the oppressor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly. I am authorized to offer you arms for
fifteen thousand men and silver enough to keep them
all in the field for several months; in return for
which, when victorious, you are to sign over eight
hundred square miles of coast territory to the German
government.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” the Sheik protested, “I own no such land,
nor do I know anyone who does. Even if the Italians
were driven out I could not justly claim it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, Sheik,” said the lieutenant gravely, “when
the Italians are driven out, you, the acknowledged
leader of all the dissatisfied Arabs in the vicinity&mdash;the
man who would be Sultan or Bey if successful&mdash;will
have as good a title to the land as another, and
the German government will accept it. Am I not
right?” he asked, turning to Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are,” Jack agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The explanation was plausible, and the Sheik was
flattered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They have heard of me in Germany, then?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed they have,” said Jack, who from previous
visits to Nalut knew something of the Sheik’s ancestry
and fortunes. “They know that your genealogy
runs back in an unbroken line far beyond the
days of Carthage, and you are looked upon as the
man of the hour in Tripoli.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Greatly pleased to hear that his name was so well
known in the land beyond the sea, the Sheik lost
whatever suspicions he might have had and accepted
the attractive proposition thus offered him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When will the arms be ready, and where will
they be landed?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They will be landed in the Gulf of Sidra day
after to-morrow,” was the lieutenant’s reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” exclaimed the Sheik. “I shall have them
removed to a secret place in the desert, not to be
used until we are fully prepared to strike. Now,
about the money?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The silver will be turned over to you in Nalut
to-morrow morning, if you will meet me there. Is
that satisfactory?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly,” returned the Sheik, and he named a
place and hour for the meeting the next day.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Arab told off two of his men as an escort,
and Jack and Lieutenant Edwards returned to the
village, where they made their way to the house in
which Jack had spent the previous night. There
they turned in, satisfied that their end of the work
had been satisfactorily accomplished.</p>

<p class='c004'>While they were at breakfast in the morning,
Hetherington burst into the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dellaya and Lord Hastings are in the village,”
he exclaimed. “Is everything all right?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everything is serene,” declared the lieutenant.
“Is the money here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; it has been taken to the house of a man
named Effidi. You are to take the Sheik there and
turn it over to him. We will see that Dellaya is a
witness of the transaction.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said the lieutenant, and he and Jack left
the house to keep their appointment with Abu ben
Sedar.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Sheik was awaiting them, and the three
made their way to the home of Effidi, where the
money was formally turned over to the Arab.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just as the transfer was being completed, the
Sheik paused suddenly to listen. His keen ear had
detected a sound in the next room. He approached
the wall and peered through a crack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dellaya,” he exclaimed in some alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” ejaculated Lieutenant Edwards, in well-feigned
surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dellaya,” repeated the Arab, “my good friend.
If all Italians were like him, the Arabs would never
resent the presence of Italian troops in Tripoli. But
they are not, so we must make haste.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Swiftly the three finished their business and Jack
and the lieutenant left the house, leaving the Sheik
in possession of the silver.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you sure the arms will be landed to-morrow?”
asked the Sheik, as they left.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” replied the lieutenant. “They will be
ready for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said the Arab. “I shall be there to get
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardly had Jack and the lieutenant disappeared
when the great Italian diplomat, followed by Lord
Hastings, made his way excitedly from the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you catch the significance of what we have
just overheard?” demanded Dellaya, of Lord Hastings,
as they hurried away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did,” replied Lord Hastings briefly. “It is fortunate
we were here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is, indeed,” was the reply. “Italy has been
the cat’spaw of the German emperor too long.
Strive as she will, Italy cannot stand by her partners
in the Triple Alliance in the face of such
treachery. But I must make sure. This ammunition
they spoke of&mdash;I must see it landed with my
own eyes. I must find this rendezvous. Will you
help me, Lord Hastings?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall be glad to,” was the reply. “My yacht is
at your service.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two hurried on their way.</p>

<p class='c004'>Returning to the house in which they had spent
the night, Jack and the lieutenant removed their disguises,
and the lieutenant made ready to take his
departure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” he said to Jack, “I want to thank you for
your aid, and I guess it is good-by, now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” demanded Jack, “can’t you take me with
you? I haven’t done much, but I might be of more
use later on. I would like to go to England with
you, so that I may offer my services to my country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant hesitated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess it can be done,” he replied finally. “You
are certainly entitled to go if you wish. Come
along, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Several hours later the two stood on the deck
of Lord Hastings’ yacht <i>Sylph</i>. Lord Hastings and
Dellaya were already there, and the lad was introduced
as a young Englishman who wished to return
to his home land. Frank already had been introduced
as an American who was desirous of getting
home. Lord Hastings declared that he was glad to
be able to help them.</p>

<p class='c004'>All that night and early the next morning the
yacht cruised about, Dellaya always on the lookout
for the sign of a ship bearing the arms and ammunition
for the Arabs. It was almost noon before
they sighted it, Dellaya still ignorant of the fact that
he had been brought there purposely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Small boats were rapidly landing arms from the
ship, unmistakably a German vessel and flying a
German flag, as the yacht bore down on it. Upon
Dellaya’s request, the yacht sailed close enough for
the Italian to see that the ship’s crew were apparently
Germans.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the great Italian diplomat signified that he
had seen enough. He turned to Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would it be too great an inconvenience for you
to cut short your cruise and take me back to Naples?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly not,” was the reply. “But what is it
you plan to do, <i>signor</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must report this strange proceeding to the Italian
Foreign Office,” declared the Italian excitedly,
“too long has Italy been a tool of Germany and
Austria.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A tool!” exclaimed Lord Hastings in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; we have been suspicious, and now our suspicions
have been confirmed. Beset by three countries
as she is, Germany still has time to plot trouble
for Italy!</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I have seen enough to thwart this outrage.
No longer will Italy be Germany’s cat’spaw. Probably
we should have gone to the Kaiser’s aid if
necessary. But now&mdash;no! So far as Italy is concerned,
the Triple Alliance is dead!”</p>

<p class='c004'>One week later, having just arrived in London,
Frank and Jack learned of the success of the
apparently trifling adventure in which they had taken
a hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Despite repeated demands of the Kaiser that Italy
live up to her obligations under the alliance, the
Italian government had refused to support the German
cause and take up arms against the Allies!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c002'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />A DESPERATE PLIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“I believe that man is following us!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Jack who spoke. He and Frank had now
been in the English metropolis two days, and to-day
were walking along the Strand, watching with the
greatest interest the preparations for war.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon all sides troops were being moved through
the streets, on their way to the front. They marched
along singing and cheering, while from the walks
great crowds cheered them as they passed. The
boys had just resumed their walk after watching
one body of troops pass, when Jack made the remark
that begins this chapter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Followed!” exclaimed Frank in surprise. “Why
should anyone follow us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure I don’t know,” was Jack’s reply; “but
just the same I am sure that man is following us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “we’ll try and see if we can’t
give him the slip. Come on!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads quickened their pace and turned quickly
into the first side street. As they rounded the next
corner they glanced back and saw that the man Jack
believed was on their trail hurrying after them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quick!” said Frank, catching Jack by the arm,
“into this store!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads dodged into an open doorway, and a
moment later saw their pursuer hurry by. The
lads immediately slipped from the store and retreated
in the direction from which they had come.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess we got rid of him, all right,” declared
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you ever seen him before?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“His face seemed familiar, but I cannot place
him,” was Jack’s reply. “Hold on, though,” he
exclaimed suddenly, “I know now who he is!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He was one of the sailors aboard Lord Hastings’
yacht. I remember that long, sharp nose.
Now what do you suppose he is following us for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve got me. However, I guess he is not
following us any longer!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Frank was wrong.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man who had been following the two boys
had not been thrown off the trail by their ruse. He
was too old a hand at the game to be shaken off so
easily; but he had recognized the fact that the boys
knew they were being shadowed. Now he kept farther
in the background, well out of sight. As a result
the lads, upon returning to the American hotel,
where they had taken rooms, were not aware that
their pursuer had followed them to its doors.</p>

<p class='c004'>After dinner the boys sat down in the lobby of
the hotel, awaiting the arrival of Hetherington, who
had promised to meet them there at 8 o’clock. A
taxi driver entered, approached the desk, and a moment
later a page started through the lobby, calling:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Templeton! Mr. Templeton!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here,” said Jack, rising.</p>

<p class='c004'>The page handed Jack a letter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s from Hetherington,” Jack told Frank, after
a hasty perusal. “Says he is unable to meet us
here, but for us to come to his place in the taxi he
has sent for us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” replied Frank. “But I must go upstairs
a moment first,” and he started hurriedly for
the elevator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll wait in the taxi,” called Jack, and he followed
the chauffeur to the street, where the taxi
stood in the shadow of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c004'>The chauffeur opened the door and the lad
climbed in. As he did so, two strong hands
reached out from the darkness of the cab and took
him by the throat, while a third hand was clapped
over his mouth to prevent his making an outcry. At
the same moment the door was slammed shut, and
the taxi rolled swiftly away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack struggled desperately, but in vain. The sudden
attack had been well timed and, struggle as
he would, Jack could not shake off the hold on his
throat, but soon sank back unconscious.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the hand upon his throat relaxed and a
voice exclaimed in German:</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s as strong as an ox. It’s a good thing both
of them didn’t come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, we have got him, all right,” came a second
voice, “and this is the one the chief wants, I
am sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When Jack regained consciousness the taxi was
still rushing swiftly along, and the lad found that
his hands were securely bound behind his back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the meaning of this?” he demanded of
the darkness of the cab.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no reply, and Jack repeated:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I say, what’s the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will know soon enough,” replied a voice in
a harsh tone. “In the meantime, if you don’t keep
quiet, we shall gag you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Under this threat, Jack held his peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>For almost an hour the taxi bowled along swiftly,
then finally came to a stop. One of Jack’s captors
alighted, and the other pushed Jack from the cab.
They dragged him up a short gravel path to a rather
pretentious looking house and into the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the house the lad was taken to the third floor,
where he was led into a nicely furnished room.
Then his hands were untied, and his captors backed
out of the room, locking the door behind them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder what on earth this is all about,” Jack
asked himself when he was left alone. “I’ll bet they
have me mixed up with someone else. Well, I’ll
have to wait and see!”</p>

<p class='c004'>For an hour Jack sat silently awaiting the arrival
of someone; but no one came.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess I might as well lie down and get a little
rest,” he told himself finally; “I’m likely to need it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He lay down on a couch at one end of the room
and was soon asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two hours later he opened his eyes again. A
drop lamp was lighted upon the table, which also
contained a tray with a most appetizing supper of
broiled squab, salad, ices and coffee. The boy
arose, and for the first time explored the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door was of oak, two inches thick, and was
bolted upon the outside. Deciding that no personal
violence was intended for the present, Jack thought
he might as well fortify himself with a good meal.</p>

<p class='c004'>As to his whereabouts he hadn’t the slightest idea.
He had scarcely finished the squab, when the door
was unlocked and a burly man with a blonde beard
and the general appearance of a savant came in.</p>

<p class='c004'>Carefully securing the door behind him, the visitor
drew a chair up to the table and comfortably
seated himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I trust the supper is to your liking, Mr. Templeton?
You have everything you wish?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Jack, as he pushed back his chair;
“and now, would an explanation of why I was
brought here be in order?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, yes, I guess so,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll be glad to hear it,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I have been led to believe that, through
the activity of England, the life of the Triple Alliance
was snuffed out. I think that admission will
do no harm; and while, of course, I might have
snared a greater bird than you&mdash;a man higher up&mdash;I
decided that you would not be so quickly missed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what have I to do with the death of the
Triple Alliance?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>The German, for such Jack knew him to be,
shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You see, we have discovered the part you played
in Tripoli,” he said. “Knowing enough to be allowed
to take part in such a coup, you must know
a great deal more. I know that the Triple Alliance
was put to death through English aid; and I know
that you know it. Also I know that you know how
it was done, and the names of all connected with
the coup. That is what I expect you to tell me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack quietly, “I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come now,” was the reply. “I know you know
these things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Admit for the sake of argument, then,” said
Jack, “that I have certain information. How do
you intend to extract it&mdash;against my will?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does appear difficult to you, doesn’t it?” was
the rejoinder. “But we have learned to manage all
that with little trouble.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll not manage me!” declared the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>The visitor smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you familiar with the weed that produces
what is called the Sleeping Sickness?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Jack, becoming interested, for he
had seen many animals unconscious for hours after
eating the weed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well,” continued the visitor. “Now, I
will tell you that we have extracted the juice of
the weed, and that the liquid can easily be mixed
with any sort of food or drink. Do you follow
me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whoever eats food or drinks anything containing
a quantity of this shortly becomes delirious, and
while in that condition will talk of the things that
have been most impressed upon his mind. In the
food you have just eaten a sufficient amount of this
tincture has been placed to put you in such a condition.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was conscious of a cold chill running
through his back at the possibilities so coolly suggested,
and his jaw set with a great determination.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But suppose I should not talk?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is not one chance in a million of failure,”
was the reply; “but, if it does fail, I shall probably
consider it necessary to do something worse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the cold chill ran through Jack’s body.
He opened his mouth to speak, but before he could
do so the visitor rose from his seat, remarking:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps you will tell me what I desire to know
without all this unpleasantness, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very good, then. I have talked enough,” and
he approached Jack. “It is time to act!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c002'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />FRANK TO THE RESCUE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Jack jumped to his feet, prepared to fight. But
before he could strike a blow he reeled and fell to
the floor. The German picked him up and laid him
on the couch. Then, unlocking the door, he called
softly. There was the sound of footsteps ascending
the stairs, and a moment later two other men
entered the room. One carried a physician’s case.
He opened it and administered a drug to the unconscious
boy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon Jack’s lips moved slightly, a few muttered
words became audible and the three men leaned
nearer to catch them. The voice became stronger:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want my pay! Two pounds four! Oh, you
would, would you! Then take that! I’ll go
through the skylight! Well, I’ve got one of them,
anyhow! Now for the next! Safe at last! I don’t
want the gold! I want two pounds four!”</p>

<p class='c004'>For an hour the Germans listened to monotonous
repetitions of the same thing&mdash;then the effect
of the drug wore off and the lips became silent.
Again the drug was administered, but the effect did
not vary by so much as a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the experiment three shadows had crept
silently upstairs. For just a moment they listened,
and then the heavy oak door was pushed open, and,
with Frank in the lead, the three entered the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank leaped forward, and with a heavy blow
sent the man who was bending over Jack reeling.
The latter drew a revolver and fired point blank
at the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Frank had seen the move, and ducked, closing
in as he did so, and the bullet sped harmlessly
over his head, imbedding itself in the door. Frank
grabbed the barrel of the revolver before the man
could fire again, and twisted&mdash;striking out with his
free hand as he did so.</p>

<p class='c004'>Struck upon the point of the jaw, the German
reeled back again, leaving his weapon in Frank’s
hand. The lad followed up his advantage and
struck his opponent another stinging blow. The
man fell to the floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the meantime, the other rescuers, who turned
out to be Hetherington and Lord Hastings, had
taken care of the other Germans. Lord Hastings,
leaping across the room at Frank’s heels, had placed
one <i>hors du combat</i> with a single blow, and Hetherington,
after a brief struggle, had succeeded in
overcoming his adversary.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank bent over Jack and shook him, but the
latter did not open his eyes. Again and again
Frank shook him, with the same result. Lord
Hastings approached the couch, reached over and
lifted Jack’s eyelids with his finger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The sleeping sickness!” he ejaculated. “I recognize
the symptoms. He must have a physician at
once. We must put him in the car and get him to
my place quick.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The unconscious lad was hastily carried to a
waiting automobile, and was soon laid on a comfortable
bed in Lord Hastings’ home.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he going to die?” asked Frank of Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not necessarily. The sleeping sickness is not
always fatal, but his condition is dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The physician arrived a few moments later, and
after a careful examination, announced that with
perfect quiet Jack would live. A little delay, he
said, would probably have proven fatal.</p>

<p class='c004'>For two days Jack hovered between life and
death, but upon the third day the physician pronounced
him out of danger. Then, for the first
time, Frank, who had removed his belongings from
the hotel to Lord Hastings’ home to be near, was
allowed to see his friend.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, old man,” he said, “you have had a narrow
escape.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So the doctor told me,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” declared Frank, “and you have proved
yourself quite a hero.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hero!” exclaimed Jack. “I haven’t done anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You haven’t, eh! Why, anyone who would go
through what you did, when you could have prevented
it by a few words, is a hero, all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, that was nothing. I was sure they wouldn’t
learn anything through me. Besides, you wouldn’t
have had me tell my country’s secrets, would you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are a good many who would have done
so rather than to go through what you did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you have told?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “I don’t know. I don’t believe
I would.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course you wouldn’t. But now, tell me how
you happened to arrive just in the nick of time. I
know I owe my life to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When I came downstairs and went to the street
to join you in the taxi,” Frank explained, “there
wasn’t any taxi in sight. I was sure you wouldn’t
have gone on without me. Recalling the fact that
we had been followed that afternoon, I became suspicious.
I put two and two together, and events
proved that I added them up right.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I got Hetherington on the telephone. He said
he had sent you no letter, and that he was just leaving
to meet us. He hurried to the hotel, and after
I explained the situation, we rushed to Lord Hastings’.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It took us four hours to find the place where
you had been taken. I certainly could never have
found it by myself. Lord Hastings had every policeman
in London interrogated, I guess, and we
finally received word that one had seen two men,
apparently carrying another, enter the house where
we found you. Lord Hastings immediately recognized
the house described as the home of a well-known
and prominent Austrian.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We rushed to the house, and it took us about
half an hour to find a way to get in, so heavily were
the windows and doors barred. Also we knew we
had to be very quiet, for, if our presence had become
known, your captors would undoubtedly have
killed you before making their escape.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We finally effected an entrance through the front
door, Lord Hastings succeeding in picking the lock
after some difficulty. Then we hurried upstairs.
We found the room you were in by the sounds of
the voices of your captors. Lord Hastings realized
immediately what the Germans were trying to do,
and we broke in the door. They put up a fight, but
we soon had them safe. That is all there is to the
story.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are they now?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, they are safe enough. They are being held
as prisoners of war, although it was first planned to
have them shot as spies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two boys were silent for some time, and
finally Frank said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack, I have an idea and I want to know how
it strikes you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. Let’s hear it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is the matter with us enlisting and seeing
a little real fighting?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, I have been figuring on that all the time.
That is why I came to England. But you are an
American. I don’t see why you should want to
fight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe I am, but my ancestors were English.
Besides, I want to see something of this war, and I
can’t see it in London. I want to be where the
fighting is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’m glad. I guess Lord Hastings can arrange
it so we can be together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess so, too. We’ll speak to him as soon as
he comes in.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />OFF TO THE WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“So you want to go to war, eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Lord Hastings who spoke. Frank and
Jack had lost no time in putting their plans before
him when he returned home the evening on which
the two lads had talked over their future.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes!” replied both lads, in the same breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings stroked his mustache.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” he said, “if you have set your minds on
going, I know there is no use of my trying to stop
you. Now, I have a plan that I believe will meet
with your approval.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys listened eagerly as Lord Hastings continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“As you know, the British home fleet is in the
North Sea, bottling the Germans up in Kiel and
Helgoland. There is likely to be a battle there almost
any time. My yacht, the <i>Sylph</i>, has been converted
into a scout cruiser, and has been heavily
armed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Although the <i>Sylph</i> is listed as being able to
make a speed of only twenty knots, nevertheless it
is swifter than any of our war vessels. This
unknown speed has been useful more than once.
My naval rank is that of captain, and I have been
ordered to the North Sea with the <i>Sylph</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” exclaimed the two lads, and Frank continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why cannot you take us with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just what I was about to propose,” declared
Lord Hastings. “Would you like to go with me, or
would you prefer to join the army?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The sea for me!” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For me, too!” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” replied Lord Hastings. “Then that part
is settled.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what will be our duties?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, while you will be only unofficial members
of the crew, in view of the service you have done
for England, I believe my influence is great enough
to have you rated as midshipmen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But we know nothing of naval warfare,” declared
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The chances are that we won’t have to do a
great deal of fighting,” explained Lord Hastings.
“But I guess you will both be able to give a good
account of yourselves if we do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We shall do the best we can,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You won’t find us shirking our duties,” Jack
agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sure of that,” replied Lord Hastings, rising.
“I must go now, and I shall try and get your appointments
to-night. I shall let you know what
success I have in the morning. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings left the room, and Frank and
Jack immediately fell into a discussion of the times
that were to come. So interested did they become
in their talk that it was well after midnight when
they finally went to bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were up bright and early the next morning,
however, so eager were they to learn the result of
Lord Hastings’ mission, and were already there
when that gentleman entered the breakfast room
with a smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” demanded Frank, so anxious that he was
unable to wait for Lord Hastings to speak, “is it all
right?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you fix it?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; it’s all right,” he replied. He drew from
his pocket two official and important looking papers.
“Here are your appointments as midshipmen in his
majesty’s navy. You have been assigned to the
<i>Sylph</i>, under my command.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurrah!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurrah!” shouted Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings smiled quietly at their enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad you are pleased,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet we are pleased,” said Jack. “We can
never thank you enough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We certainly can’t,” declared Frank. “But when
do we go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, don’t get excited,” laughed Lord Hastings.
“There is plenty of time. We shall go on
board the <i>Sylph</i> to-night and sail about midnight.
Now come with me, and we’ll see about getting
your uniforms.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Their uniforms obtained and their other needs
having been supplied, the boys spent the rest of
the day strolling about the city. So great was their
impatience to be off that the hours dragged by
slowly and time hung heavily on their hands as they
wandered about, waiting for six o’clock, when they
were to meet Lord Hastings at his home.</p>

<p class='c004'>As with everything, however, the time came and
passed, and Frank and Jack at last stood again
upon the deck of the <i>Sylph</i>. It was almost midnight
when the little scout cruiser finally slipped her cable
and steamed proudly down the Thames.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “we are off at last. I wonder
where we shall be next month at this time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who knows?” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>For several hours the two lads stood upon the
deck, gazing over the rail into the dark waters of
the river; but at length they turned in.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>Sylph</i> was manned with a crew of 100 men,
besides her officers. A small cruiser, she nevertheless
had been an extremely large-sized yacht. All
told she mounted ten eight-inch guns and several
smaller pieces.</p>

<p class='c004'>Used frequently as she had been by Lord Hastings
on diplomatic and political missions, the <i>Sylph</i>
had always been prepared to resist an attack, so
that her present armament was only twice what it
had been.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the <i>Sylph</i> would stand little chance against
one of the great German dreadnoughts or battle
cruisers, Lord Hastings had little doubt that she
could give a good account of herself in an encounter
with some of the enemy’s smaller vessels. If he
encountered one of the enemy’s bigger vessels, it
was Lord Hastings’ plan to run, and he was positive
that he could not be overhauled; for the <i>Sylph</i>
had the heels of practically anything afloat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Officers and crew were trained to the minute.
Picked from among the flower of Britain’s sailors,
drilled so that they went about their work like well-oiled
cogs in a great machine, they were all eager
to get into action.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although rated as midshipmen, Frank and Jack
were not assigned to fixed stations. They had been
given a cabin just off the one occupied by Lord
Hastings. The <i>Sylph</i>, ostensibly a pleasure yacht,
had been fitted up with roomy and beautiful cabins,
and this space, although the yacht now was a war
cruiser, necessarily had to be utilized.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under Lord Hastings, Lieutenant Edwards was
the second in command. The next two ranking officers
were Second Lieutenant Taylor and Third
Lieutenant Harvey.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bright sunlight streamed into the cabin occupied
by the two boys when they awoke the morning following
their departure from London. They jumped
up, dressed hurriedly, and went on deck. There
was no land in sight, nor was there even a sail in
the distance; nothing but water as far as the eye
could see.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little cruiser steamed swiftly along, rising and
falling gently with the swell of the sea. For a long
time the boys stood gazing out over the water, and
they were still there when Lord Hastings approached.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning,” he greeted them. “How do
you think you will like life on the ocean wave?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s glorious,” replied both lads in a single voice.
“Where are we?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are headed straight for the North Sea,” was
the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is there any danger of our meeting a German
warship?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very little. Of course, there may be a cruiser
prowling about, but I doubt it. I did hear, however,
that there was a German cruiser in these waters
several days ago. Nothing has been heard of her
since, in spite of a keen search. She has probably
put into some neutral port. In that event she must
either leave in twenty-four hours or disarm until
the end of the war.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are we to join the fleet immediately?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, not immediately. We shall do some scouting
for several days off the Scandinavian coast, trying
to pick up some of the Germans who, under
neutral colors, have been laying mines in the North
Sea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But isn’t there some danger of our striking a
mine?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not around here. Farther along, of course, we
shall have to be extremely careful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For two days the <i>Sylph</i> continued on her way
without incident.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack quickly fell into the routine life
aboard the cruiser, and performed such duties as
were from time to time assigned to them in such
manner as to draw forth the praise of Lord Hastings
and his officers.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was on the third evening after leaving London
that Frank and Jack, who were standing on deck,
were startled by a cry from the lookout:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cruiser off the port bow, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The word was passed and Lord Hastings quickly
appeared on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A German, as sure as I am a foot high!” he
declared, after a long and careful scrutiny through
his glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’s a German, sir,” agreed Lieutenant Edwards,
“and she is headed directly for us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll go a little closer, and try to make out her
identity,” was Lord Hastings’ order. “Slow down
to fifteen knots!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon the ship, at first but a speck in the distance,
was close enough for Lord Hastings to make out
her colors.</p>

<p class='c004'>“American!” he said; then turning to Lieutenant
Edwards, added:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Try her on the wireless!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No reply,” came the answer from the wireless
room a few moments later.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still the ships continued to draw nearer to each
other.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the American flag at the masthead of
the stranger fluttered down, and a moment later the
German colors were run up in its stead.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the same moment a loud boom sounded from
across the water, and there was a great splash in
the water behind the <i>Sylph</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wireless operator approached Lord Hastings:</p>

<p class='c004'>“A message from the German, sir!” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings took the slip of paper extended to
him, and read aloud:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Surrender, or we shall blow you out of the
water!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />A BRUSH WITH THE ENEMY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Lord Hastings turned to the operator with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell him to blow away!” he said, and the operator
departed, grinning broadly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first shades of darkness were now beginning
to encircle the little vessel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The enemy has the range of us,” said Lord
Hastings to Lieutenant Edwards, as a second shell
whistled over the bow of the vessel, kicking up a
great splash in the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” was the reply; “our guns are ineffective
at this distance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Under Lord Hastings’ command, the <i>Sylph</i>
came about, and headed back in the way she had
come.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What would you say she is making?” asked
Lord Hastings of Lieutenant Edwards, indicating
the approaching German cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>“About twenty-one knots, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. Set our speed at twenty-four, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>Sylph</i> seemed to leap forward. Then Lord
Hastings took the time to explain his plans.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We don’t want to run entirely away from her,”
he explained. “We want to keep just enough ahead
of her so she will continue the chase. Darkness
will be upon us in an hour. I should like to capture
that cruiser single-handed, and some method may
present itself. But in the meantime we must keep
out of range of her big guns.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>Sylph</i> gradually drew away from her pursuer.
When the distance between the two vessels
was such that Lord Hastings deemed accurate
shooting by the German impossible, the speed of
the <i>Sylph</i> was reduced to twenty-one knots.</p>

<p class='c004'>These relative positions the two vessels maintained
until darkness fell; then the glare of a searchlight
aboard the German fell upon the <i>Sylph</i> and
lighted her up like day. So the chase continued
for another hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the wireless operator came on deck, and
rushed breathlessly up to Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have just picked up the British cruiser <i>Lancaster</i>,”
he cried. “I told her we were being chased
by a German cruiser, and she is coming to our aid.
She gave her position as twenty miles west of us,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” replied Lord Hastings. “Keep in touch
with the <i>Lancaster</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The operator departed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How is she headed?” demanded Lord Hastings
of Lieutenant Edwards.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Due west, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Make it west by south,” ordered Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very good, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Gradually the <i>Sylph</i> bore off toward the south,
the German cruiser still in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c004'>For more than an hour the chase continued, the
<i>Sylph</i> still keeping the same distance ahead of the
German. Then from the northwest came the distant
flash of another searchlight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ship off the starboard bow, sir!” came the cry
of the lookout.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Slow to fifteen knots!” came Lord Hastings’
order, and there was a perceptible diminishing in
the speed of the <i>Sylph</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still the German cruiser came on, quickly reducing
the distance between the two vessels. Then,
suddenly, the light that illumined the <i>Sylph</i> disappeared;
the searchlight on the German had been
turned in another direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She has sighted the <i>Lancaster</i>, sir,” said Lieutenant
Edwards.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So she has,” replied Lord Hastings. “Bring
the <i>Sylph</i> about, and make your course north by
east, Lieutenant Edwards.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very good, sir,” was the lieutenant’s reply, and
the <i>Sylph</i> came about quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardly had the little vessel laid herself out on
her new course, when Lord Hastings’ voice rang
out:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Full speed ahead!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>Sylph</i> jumped forward like some live thing,
and headed in the direction of the German cruiser,
still bearing somewhat to the south.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack watched all these maneuvers
with the greatest of interest. When the word was
passed that the vessel approaching was a German
cruiser, the boys had been greatly excited; and,
when the <i>Sylph</i> had turned and fled from the
enemy, their disappointment knew no bounds.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” Frank exclaimed. “We are running
away!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe Lord Hastings is the man to
run very far,” Jack replied. “Besides, you can see
as well as I can that the <i>Sylph</i> is no match for the
German. She would shoot us out of the water before
she approached within range of our guns.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps so,” returned Frank, “but just the same
I would rather fight than run away from that
cruiser, big as she is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I feel the same way. But 'discretion is the better
part of valor,’ you know. Besides, I believe
Lord Hastings has some scheme in his mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I hope so,” declared Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys had spied the distant light of the approaching
<i>Lancaster</i> practically at the same moment
as had the lookout; and, when the <i>Sylph</i> once more
came about and headed toward the German cruiser,
Jack exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did I tell you? I said Lord Hastings
wasn’t the man to run far, no matter how great
the odds against him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right,” was Frank’s reply. “It looks
as though we were to see a little action.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and it’s likely to be a pretty sizable fight,
or I miss my guess,” returned Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>For fear of giving notice of their approach to
the enemy, who now apparently had forgotten the
existence of the <i>Sylph</i> in the approach of the <i>Lancaster</i>,
the call to quarters was not sounded on the
<i>Sylph</i>. Upon orders of Lord Hastings, Frank and
Jack went quietly about the ship, summoning the
men to their posts.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was not a light upon the <i>Sylph</i> as the little
vessel bore down upon the enemy. The searchlight
of the <i>Lancaster</i> now enveloped the German, and
the searchlight of the latter now played upon the
swiftly oncoming British cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the <i>Sylph</i> everything was ready for the struggle.
The perfectly drilled crew had cleared for
action in no time. Lord Hastings and Lieutenant
Edwards made a round of inspection, and spoke
inspiring words to the members of the crew.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Remember the words of Lord Nelson,” cried
the former, “'England expects every man to do his
duty!’”</p>

<p class='c004'>A cheer was quickly silenced when Lord Hastings
raised his hand for quiet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our chance of coming out of this engagement
alive,” Lord Hastings said to the gun crews, “is
that you make every shot count. A vital spot must
be hit at the first fire. The enemy’s great guns
would tear us to pieces. If we can take them by
surprise, we have more than an even chance of success.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings returned to his place on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nearer and still nearer the <i>Sylph</i> crept toward
her foe; and now the speed was reduced to fifteen
knots.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Another ten minutes and we shall be near
enough to strike,” declared Lord Hastings to the
group of officers about him. He turned to Jack
and Frank. “Take your posts,” he said, “and keep
me informed if we are struck and what damage
is done by the enemy’s fire.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Jack descended to the lower deck&mdash;now
converted into the gun deck. Both lads were
trembling with eagerness and excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you feel, Jack,” asked Frank, “scared?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, not exactly,” was the reply. “I feel rather
funny, though.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Same here,” said Frank, “but I guess we’ll get
over that as soon as things break loose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; and they’re about due to break,” declared
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Members of the gun crews joked each other
good-naturedly, as they waited for the command to
fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>And still there was a death-like silence on the
<i>Sylph</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Frank at last. “This
is the longest ten minutes I ever saw!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you worry,” replied Jack, “they’ll be
over&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then suddenly it came. Even from where they
stood, the boys could hear the clear, quiet voice
of Lord Hastings:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant Edwards, you may fire at will!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />THE BATTLE!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>There was an instant of awful silence; then
came the command:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fire!”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a horrible noise, louder by far than
the loudest clap of thunder; the <i>Sylph</i> quivered,
then seemed to leap back. The big guns on the
starboard side of the little vessel had poured forth
their volley.</p>

<p class='c004'>So close had the <i>Sylph</i> approached to the enemy
without being discovered that a miss was impossible;
and the suddenness of this unexpected attack
took the Germans completely off their guard. There
came a voice from above:</p>

<p class='c004'>“A hit! A hit!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>Sylph</i> now shook and trembled continuously,
as broadside after broadside was poured into the
enemy, first from one side and then from the other,
as the little vessel maneuvered, presenting first one
side and then the other to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although taken practically unprepared, the
Germans had no mind to give up without a fight. One
of the shells from the <i>Sylph</i> had passed through
the cabin of the commander, leaving death and ruin
in its wake; a second tore a great hole through the
smokestack, and she had been pierced in other vulnerable
spots.</p>

<p class='c004'>The marksmanship of the British gunners was
superb!</p>

<p class='c004'>But now the Germans had brought their big
guns to bear on the little vessel. There was a gigantic
boom, followed immediately by the sound of
a great crash. The shell had struck one of the
guns of the <i>Sylph</i>, blowing it to pieces.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a shower of iron, and men fell on all
sides as it rained upon the deck. At Gun No. 2 the
gunner crumpled up and fell to the deck just as he
was about to fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Report this to Lord Hastings!” cried Jack to
Frank, and the latter rushed upon deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack leaped to the gun and touched it off with
his own hand. His action was rewarded by a great
shout from on deck, followed by a terrific explosion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another German shell struck the gun deck of the
<i>Sylph</i>, and again several men went to the deck. But
as they fell others jumped to take their places, Jack
among them.</p>

<p class='c004'>For another few minutes the battle raged without
cessation. Jack continued to work like a
Trojan; Frank, returning from above, where he had
reported to Lord Hastings, saw his friend running,
shouting, fighting with the others, stripped to the
waist.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a shout, Frank rushed to his side, arriving
just in time to touch off a gun as the gunner fell
beside it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, suddenly, there came from above the command:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cease firing!”</p>

<p class='c004'>As if by magic the night became still. After the
great noise and confusion of the battle the sudden
stillness was so intense that the boys’ ears hurt.
Then they made their way to the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>And what a sight met their eyes!</p>

<p class='c004'>Before them the sea was covered with a mass
of wreckage. The stately German cruiser of a
few minutes before was like so much floating débris.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Jack. “Did we do all
that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess we did,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chadwick! Mr. Templeton!” came the
voice of Lord Hastings. “You will man two of the
boats at once and pick up as many as possible of
those poor fellows in the sea!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads rushed to obey this order, and soon were
busily engaged in rescuing the German sailors clinging
to the débris and swimming about in the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>For almost an hour they rowed about, picking up
the unfortunate Germans.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although a mass of wreckage, the German
cruiser had not yet sunk, but it was plainly apparent
that it was settling rapidly. On the bridge Jack
made out the form of a man in uniform. It was
undoubtedly the commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By George,” declared Jack, “we must get him
off!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s no use,” spoke up one of the German officers
who had been picked up. “He refused to leave the
ship. We tried to prevail upon him to jump, but
he said he would stick to his post.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Even so,” replied Jack, “we must make an
effort to save him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s useless,” repeated the German.</p>

<p class='c004'>The little boat was rowed closer in spite of the
German’s words, and Jack called to the German
commander:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jump, sir, and we will save you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The German looked at the lad, but made no reply,
and Jack repeated:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jump. We will get you all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly the German commander drew a revolver,
and, pointing it at the boat, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep away, or I shall fire!”</p>

<p class='c004'>As Jack did not immediately order his men to
move away, the German officer in the boat exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“You would better do as he says. Besides, the
ship will sink in a moment, and the suction will
draw us under if we do not move from here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At the same moment Frank, returning to the
<i>Sylph</i> with his boat filled with survivors, called:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get back quick, Jack, or you will be drawn
under!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack looked once more at the German commander,
who still stood with leveled revolver, and
then turned to his men:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give way!” he commanded, and the little boat
headed once more for the <i>Sylph</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The small boat withdrew from the danger zone
none too soon.</p>

<p class='c004'>When still a few yards from the <i>Sylph</i>, Jack
turned his face toward the sinking cruiser. As he
did so, the sinking craft gave a convulsive shudder,
then the sea closed over it. The last thing that
Jack saw was the commander, standing calmly on
the bridge, awaiting the end. He went to his death
with bared head, standing at attention. Jack will
remember the sight till his dying day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A brave man!” was all he said, lifting his cap
from his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>Back on the <i>Sylph</i>, Frank and Jack learned that
the casualties in the battle had been comparatively
slight. Ten men had been killed and twenty-two
wounded. Two of the latter were not expected to
live. The German shells had done considerable
damage to the <i>Sylph</i>, particularly upon the gun
deck. Lord Hastings declared, however, that this
could be patched up with very little difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was during a talk with Lord Hastings, while
the commander of the <i>Sylph</i> and the two boys
watched the approach of the British cruiser <i>Lancaster</i>,
that Jack learned just what an important
part he had played in the engagement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was a single shot that put the German out
of business,” declared Lord Hastings. “It was just
after the first fire from the German hit us, killing
some of the gun crew.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack looked surprised, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A second later,” continued Lord Hastings,
“there was a single shot from the <i>Sylph</i>. The shell
penetrated to the magazine on the cruiser, and it
exploded. Although the Germans fought for some
time thereafter, that was the shot that decided the
battle; it was the shot that sunk the ship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to Jack. “You were in the gun room
at the time,” he said; “do you know who fired that
shot?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” replied Jack, in some confusion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who was it, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I fired it, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” exclaimed Lord Hastings and Frank in
the same breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir, I fired it; but it was just luck that I hit
anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A shot like that can hardly be called luck,” replied
Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, it was luck as far as I am concerned,”
said Jack. “The gun had already been sighted. I
just touched it off when Mitchel fell to the deck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The hand of Providence has surely been with
us this night,” declared Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>A sailor approached with a message.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A message from the wireless room, sir,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings took the paper he extended. He
read aloud:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your report received. Congratulations on your
gallant victory. We are proud of you all, and are
sorry we could not be in at the death. Stand by,
I am coming on board. Will relieve you of your
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Edwards approached at this juncture
and saluted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />SAVED FROM THE SEA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A few moments later a man, whose uniform proclaimed
him a captain in the British navy, clambered
over the rail to the deck of the <i>Sylph</i>. Lord
Hastings advanced to meet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A great piece of work, sir!” exclaimed Captain
Mayfair, as he grasped Lord Hastings’ hand. “Allow
me to congratulate you again!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two men disappeared in the direction of
Lord Hastings’ cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wounded on the <i>Sylph</i> by this time had been
cared for and the dead prepared for burial. Jack
and Frank had lent what assistance they could in
this work, and now had returned upon deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, that was a pretty lively little scrap,” said
the latter, as they leaned against the rail and looked
out over the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should say it was,” replied Jack. “I was
scared, too, for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe you were, but you didn’t show it. The
way you went about your work on the gun deck,
with men dropping on all sides, didn’t look much
like you were afraid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I was, just the same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And to think that you fired the shot that decided
the battle!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was nothing but an accident, as I told
Lord Hastings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps so; but it was a fortunate accident for
us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Further conversation was interrupted by the approach
of Lord Hastings and Captain Mayfair.
Lord Hastings introduced the two lads to the British
commander, and the latter, laying his hand on
Jack’s shoulder, exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“So this is the lad who won the battle! It was a
great piece of work, and England will not forget
your action!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack blushed in his confusion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have told Lord Hastings, sir, that it was only
an accident,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nevertheless, your actions at such a time
showed bravery and quickness of wit,” returned
Captain Mayfair. Then, turning to Lord Hastings:
“But I must go now. I shall send boats to relieve
you of your prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He shook hands all around, disappeared over the
side and was rowed back to the <i>Lancaster</i>. A short
time later the German prisoners captured by the
<i>Sylph</i> were lowered into small boats, sent by the
<i>Lancaster</i>, and, when the last had been disposed of,
the <i>Sylph</i> continued on her journey toward the
east.</p>

<p class='c004'>Late in the afternoon of the following day,
Frank, who stood upon the bridge, made out a distant
speck upon the horizon. Save for this one
little dot on the water, there was nothing in sight
but the sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank reported his discovery to Lord Hastings,
who ordered the <i>Sylph’s</i> head turned in that direction.
He finally picked up the object with his glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like a bit of driftwood,” he declared,
after a long scrutiny. “I guess there is no need of
going further,” and he turned with an order to alter
the <i>Sylph’s</i> course on his lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>But at that moment Frank, who also had been
gazing through a glass, cried:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is someone on it, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings stayed his command, and again
leveled his glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So there is,” he said finally, and ordered the
<i>Sylph</i> forward with even greater speed. Presently
the vessel drew close enough for the naked eye to
discern a figure lying upon what appeared to be a
small raft.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chadwick, take the launch and bring that
man aboard,” ordered Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank leaped to obey, and under his direction the
launch was soon alongside the raft. As it drew
close, the figure on the raft stirred, and then sat
up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” ejaculated Frank. “It’s a girl!”</p>

<p class='c004'>As suddenly as she had sat up, the girl dropped
back again. Frank stood up in the launch, and, as
the little boat drew up against the raft, he leaned
over and picked up the girl and drew her into the
launch. Then he ordered his men to return to the
<i>Sylph</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Aboard the little scout cruiser the girl was taken
below, and finally was revived by the use of stimulants.
Then, without uttering a word, she fell back
again, and soon her deep, regular breathing proclaimed
that she was asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank returned on deck, where Jack was waiting
for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder who she is, and what she was doing
out there?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She is probably a survivor of some wreck,” replied
Jack. “Did she say anything?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; she did not recover consciousness until a
moment ago. Then she immediately fell asleep.
She is plainly exhausted after the peril she has undergone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess we shall find out all about her
when she wakes up,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings, Lieutenant Edwards, Second
Lieutenant Taylor, Frank and Jack sat at supper
when word was brought that the girl was awake
and desired to speak to the commander of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Escort her here,” commanded Lord Hastings,
and he ordered a place set for her at the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few moments later the girl appeared in the
doorway. Frank, Jack and the officers rose, and
Lord Hastings advanced to meet her, with extended
hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are glad to have been of assistance to you,”
he said, “and welcome you to supper, Miss&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>He paused.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Beulow,” said the girl; “Alice Beulow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Beulow,” repeated Lord Hastings, “won’t
you be seated?”</p>

<p class='c004'>After an introduction all around, the girl took
the seat indicated, between Frank and Second Lieutenant
Taylor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank gave her one swift glance as she sat down.
Apparently about seventeen years of age, her face
was unmistakably Teutonic, but she spoke English
clearly and without an accent. She was tall and
slender, and, Frank noted, very pretty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have Mr. Chadwick to thank for our timely
arrival,” Lord Hastings told her. “But for his keen
eyes we should probably have passed without seeing
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl smiled brightly at Frank, and he blushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know I can never repay you,” she said, “and
thanks are unnecessary for such a deed. I hope
some day to show my appreciation, as will my
father, when he learns how his daughter’s life has
been saved.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure I am glad to have been of service to
you, Miss Beulow,” replied Frank. “But now
won’t you tell us how you came to be in such a
serious predicament?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s not a long story,” said the girl, “although
it seems ages that I have passed through. In the
first place,” turning from one to another with a
smile, “I suppose you know that I am German?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I surmised as much,” he replied, “although I
was unable to account for your excellent English.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you see, while my father is a German,
my mother is an American. I have been going to
school in Massachusetts. When school was over
this summer, mother and I went to California, and
after returning east, went to visit my aunt in Copenhagen.
Mother decided to stay several weeks
longer, but I was anxious to see father, and so
sailed without waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Regular traffic across the North Sea has been
suspended, but I found, upon inquiry, a German
vessel that was ready to make a dash for Kiel. I
was anxious to get home, so I took passage, although
I had to do an awful lot of talking before
the captain would consent to taking me.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We were hardly out of sight of land when a
British cruiser came after us. The captain would
not surrender, and fled. The British ship gave
chase. In the darkness we succeeded in eluding our
pursuer and in the morning had drawn out of sight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just as the captain was congratulating himself
upon his successful flight, there was a sudden terrific
explosion, and we seemed to shoot high in the
air.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A hidden mine, I suppose,” interrupted Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied the girl. “I heard the captain
make that remark as I seemed to sail high in the
air. A moment later I found myself in the water
struggling. All around me I heard cries and shouts.
My hand came in contact with something and I
grasped it. It appeared to be a raft, and, after a
hard struggle, I pulled myself upon it, almost exhausted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I think I must have fainted, for, when
again I looked about me, I could see nothing but
water. I had no food and no water to drink, and
when I realized this I broke down and cried.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And no wonder!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All that day and night, and late into the following
night I watched for some sign of a vessel,
but I saw none. After that I remember nothing
until I awoke upon this ship.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You certainly have had a strenuous time,” declared
Lord Hastings, “almost three days alone in
the middle of the sea without food or drink is
enough to shatter the nerves of the most hardy.
I can only wonder that you bear up so bravely
now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Beulow is certainly a remarkable young
lady,” agreed Lieutenant Taylor, glancing at her
admiringly. “I hope that we shall not soon lose
her company,” and he smiled at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl ignored this piece of gallantry, and
turned to Frank, and the two were soon engaged in
a little conversation of their own.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What am I to do with you, Miss Beulow?”
asked Lord Hastings at length. “I had not planned
to put into port for days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is not necessary,” replied the girl. “I
would not put you to such inconvenience, although
I suppose I should look upon you as an enemy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope you may never do that,” said Lord Hastings
gallantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure I never shall,” replied the girl. “I
suppose the proper thing is for me to remain here
until you put into some port. Father probably is
with the army, and will not know of my disappearance,
and mother will think I have arrived
home safely. Yes, I guess that is the best thing
to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whatever you say. Miss Beulow,” replied Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When you land you may give me my liberty,”
continued the young girl. “In the meantime, I am
a prisoner of war; and, in that case, I must give
my parole, mustn’t I?” she asked, with a bright
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings humored her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you will,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, then, I give my word that I shall make
no attempt to escape,” and with that she arose, took
the arm Frank offered her, and the two went on
deck.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />A PLOT OVERHEARD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Great Scott, Jack! Look!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Frank who spoke. The two boys were
standing in the shadow in the bow of the <i>Sylph</i>.
Jack looked in the direction his companion pointed.
A solitary figure was skulking along the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see a man,” replied Jack. “What about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Didn’t you recognize him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; who is he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The same man who followed us in the streets
of London!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“By George! You don’t mean it. Why haven’t
we seen him before?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is wearing a thick mustache. I don’t suppose
I would have recognized him now if I hadn’t
caught a side glimpse of his face.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you sure he is the man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no question about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what do you suppose he is doing here,
skulking about the deck?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, but he is up to no good, I’ll warrant.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are right. Let’s follow him and see where
he goes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good! Come on!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Stealthily the lads followed in the steps of the
sailor, keeping well in the shadow and far enough
behind to prevent discovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>Unaware that he was being followed, the sailor
made his way straight to the cabin of Second Lieutenant
Taylor. There he gave a sharp, peculiar
knock, and the door was immediately opened. The
man disappeared inside.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something up,” whispered Frank to Jack.
“Guess we had better find out what is going on in
there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The second lieutenant’s cabin was in the after
part of the vessel, and a window overlooked the
deck. The window was lowered a trifle, permitting
a gleam of light to stream across the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two boys approached and cautiously peered
into the cabin. They saw Lieutenant Taylor and
the sailor seated at a small table, on which were a
bottle and glasses, and they could plainly overhear
the conversation that passed between them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t like this eavesdropping business, but it
is up to us to learn what is going on,” whispered
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right you are,” replied Frank. “This looks
suspicious to me. What business do you suppose
Lieutenant Taylor can have with a man we are
bound to believe is a German spy?“</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s too much for me,” said Jack; “but if we listen
we may overhear something worth while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two boys became silent, and, with their eyes
to the small open space at the top of the window,
listened breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How is everything going?” they heard the sailor
ask Lieutenant Taylor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As well as could be expected,” was the reply.
“I haven’t been able to do anything yet, however,
for Lord Hastings has received no definite information
or instructions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But he will? Are you sure of that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly. There are only a few men acquainted
with Hastings’ connection with the British Admiralty.
A captain of a scout ship, eh! Why, I know
that if he chose he could, with the instructions he
now holds, take command of the entire British fleet
in the North Sea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that so? Then you are positive we made no
mistake when we selected the <i>Sylph</i> as the best
place to learn England’s naval plans?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Absolutely positive. Not a move will be made
of which Hastings has not had previous information.
In spite of the wireless, this vessel is the real
connecting link between the British Home Office
and the North Sea fleet. I have it on good authority
that, until further notice, Hastings will receive
all messages from both directions. The reason for
this, I understand, is that the government puts the
utmost faith in his ability and loyalty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” replied the sailor. “Now what are your
plans?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, a whole lot will depend upon circumstances;
but the first thing I want you to do is to
put yourself into the confidence of the wireless
operator. In some manner I must have a copy of
every message received and sent. Of course, all
messages will be in code, but I have the key to that.
You are an operator, are you not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. I must be kept posted, so that at
the proper moment I can act. At that moment,
your duty will be to transmit a message I shall give
you. Before doing so, however, you will have to
dispose of the operator.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll attend to him,” broke in the sailor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good. If there is no slip up in our plans, it will
mean the destruction of the British fleet. Our work
completed, we shall make our escape at night in the
launch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And our reward?” asked the sailor, as he rose
to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, yes, our reward,” repeated Lieutenant Taylor,
with a harsh laugh. “We are doing this for a
reward, aren’t we? Well, promises will be kept.
The Kaiser will reward us handsomely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no reason to believe that we are suspected?”
asked the sailor, as he moved toward the
door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not the slightest; and if we are careful, we can
put this thing through without arousing suspicion.
Good night. I want to turn in early as I must be
about at daylight. I want to show the young lady
we picked up to-day about the vessel. I understand
her father is a high officer in the German
army, and with the success of our venture&mdash;well,
who knows?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You take my advice and let the girl alone,”
growled the sailor. “A woman has spoiled more
than one well-laid scheme.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Keep your advice to yourself, Hardy,” replied
the lieutenant angrily. “Now, good night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack and Frank straightened up from their
cramped position, slipped quickly down the deck
and disappeared before the sailor emerged from
the lieutenant’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, what do you think of that?” demanded
Jack, as the two boys sat down in their own cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know what to think,” replied Frank.
“Great Scott! Suppose no one had learned of their
plans! What would have happened then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know what might have happened,” returned
Jack. “It certainly is a good thing you spotted
that sailor, Hardy. We might not have had
another chance of overhearing their plans.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose the thing to do now is to inform Lord
Hastings at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose so. Or no, I believe it would do just
as well to wait until morning. He has retired and
there is no use arousing him. The plotters can do
nothing to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess you are right. By the way, what do
you think of Taylor’s remarks about Miss Beulow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe you are more interested in remarks
concerning Miss Beulow than I am,” replied Jack,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank blushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, maybe so,” he said. “But she is a nice
girl, and I don’t believe she would have much use
for a traitor, even though he is plotting to deliver
England into the hands of her own country. Do
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know anything about it,” was the reply.
“You can ask her in the morning if you like. In
the meantime, let’s get some sleep.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />A TRAP IS SET.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was late the following morning when Frank
and Jack succeeded in gaining a private hearing
with Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now what is it you have on your mind?” he
asked, when they were finally seated in his cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are traitors on board, sir,” said Frank
quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings bounded to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is that you say?” he exclaimed. “Traitors?
It is impossible. You should be more careful
of your language.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is true, sir,” said Jack. “We overheard them
plotting last night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings slowly resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know you must have good reason for your
words,” he replied; “but I can scarcely credit them.
Who are these traitors?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “one of them is the man
who followed Jack and me in London. He is a
sailor on board, but, owing to a false mustache,
I did not recognize him until last night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the other?” queried Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The other,” said Frank, “you will find it very
hard to believe is plotting against England. He is
an officer on board, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“His name?” demanded Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Second Lieutenant Taylor, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” exclaimed Lord Hastings, jumping to
his feet in great excitement. “Lieutenant Taylor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” said Jack. “We overheard the two
of them plotting last night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings paced back and forth for several
moments. Then he sat down again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell me what you heard,” he commanded at
length.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank related, almost word for word, the conversation
the boys had overheard between Lieutenant
Taylor and the sailor, Hardy, the night before.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a long time after Frank had finished Lord
Hastings sat wrapped in thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It seems incredible,” he muttered at length; “but
I am forced to believe that your words are true.”
Then suddenly to Jack: “Mr. Templeton!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sir!” and the midshipman’s hand came to a
salute.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Summon Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant
Taylor. Then have the word passed for Hardy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” and Jack moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“May I make so bold as to offer a suggestion,
sir?” Frank asked, before Jack could leave the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may,” was the reply, and Lord Hastings
motioned Jack to resume his seat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would suggest, then, sir,” said Frank, “that,
for the time being, matters be allowed to stand as
they are. Now that we know their plans, they
can do no damage. In fact, by a little judicious
juggling of the wireless we might even be able to
turn the presence of the plotters here to our advantage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In what way?” demanded Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, sir,” explained Frank, “suppose they are
furnished with wrong information? Not knowing
that they are discovered, they will continue with
their plans. Lieutenant Taylor said that the success
of their plan would mean the destruction of the
British North Sea fleet. Evidently they intend,
through the 'fake’ message he spoke of, to lead the
fleet into a trap when they believe the time is ripe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My idea exactly,” interrupted Lord Hastings;
“but go on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, they must be allowed to gain a certain
amount of authentic information, so as not to
arouse their suspicions. But, at the proper time, we
must see that they get such false information as
will lead them to believe it is time for them to act.
In some manner, probably by wireless, Lieutenant
Taylor plans to communicate with the German fleet
at Helgoland. That is why our operator must be
disposed of. They must be allowed to do this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?” asked Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So that false plans of the British fleet having
been sent to the Germans&mdash;false plans that we must
prepare carefully&mdash;we shall trap the German fleet,
or a portion of it, instead of being trapped ourselves.
In this manner we may be able to strike
the first naval blow of the war.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mean that we may succeed in drawing the
German fleet into the open?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir. Of course Admiral Jellicoe must be
informed of how matters stand and how they progress,
so that he may act in conjunction with us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For fully half an hour Lord Hastings sat twirling
his thumbs, turning this scheme over in his
mind. Neither Frank nor Jack interrupted his
meditations, both awaiting his decision anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The only difficulty I can see in your plan,” said
Lord Hastings finally, “is how we shall get word to
Admiral Jellicoe without the plotters overhearing.
You say Hardy is an operator?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Frank, “but whenever we are
ready to send a communication to Admiral Jellicoe
that we do not wish overheard, or to any other
place, it will be very simple for Lieutenant Taylor,
and Hardy also, to be ordered to some duty at the
far end of the vessel at that moment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So it will,” said Lord Hastings, slapping his
knee. “Your plan is a splendid one; and, if it works
out, as I believe it will, you will have rendered England
a tremendous service&mdash;one that shall never be
forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you will act upon my suggestion, sir?”
exclaimed Frank with great delight.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall; and I want to say that I am proud to
have two such youngsters with me. Why, you both
have been of greater value to me than I ever believed
it possible for anyone to be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, sir,” said both lads in a single voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may go now,” Lord Hastings continued,
“while I remain and work out the details of the
plan. And remember, not a word of this to a soul.
Send Lieutenant Edwards to me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys saluted and left the commander’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>Emerging upon deck, they saw Lieutenant Edwards
and Miss Beulow strolling about. They approached
the couple.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord Hastings requests that you report to him
at once,” said Frank, coming to a salute.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant departed, and the two boys and
the young German girl continued their promenade.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, well, how is our little enemy this morning?”
came a voice suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning, they beheld the smiling countenance of
Lieutenant Taylor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, thank you,” replied Miss Beulow
coldly, then ignoring the lieutenant, turned to the
two boys and resumed her conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, come,” continued the lieutenant, “don’t
be so standoffish. I like you, even if you are a German.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl made no answer to this remark, and the
lieutenant, after gazing resentfully at her a moment,
took himself off.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know,” the girl confided to the two
boys, “I do not like your Lieutenant Taylor. He
seems out of place among the rest of you, and it
seems to me I have seen him some place before,
though I cannot remember where.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This remark pleased Frank hugely, although, for
some reason he was unable to explain why, even
to himself. Aloud he only said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess it’s just his way, Miss Beulow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps,” was the reply; “but I don’t like his
way.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />FRANK MAKES AN ENEMY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“You little whipper snapper! What do you
mean by making remarks about me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>A hand was laid on Frank’s shoulder and he was
jerked roughly around, to find the angry face of
Lieutenant Taylor confronting him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank shook himself loose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have been making no remarks about you,” he
said quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, you have,” was the angry reply. “Trying
to shine up to the little German girl, are you?” and
the lieutenant laughed sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here,” said Frank, his face turning red,
“you leave Miss Beulow out of this. If you have
anything to say to me, say it and get out of my
way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You dare to talk like that to your superior officer?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I dare; and I’ll say a whole lot more if
you don’t get away from me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will, eh? Do you know what I have a
mind to do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No; and I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you will care. I have a mind to give you
a good trimming,” and the lieutenant advanced
threateningly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wouldn’t try it if I were you,” said Frank
quietly. “You might get more than you bargained
for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What! Do you think you are any match for
me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess not. But let me tell you something:
You keep away from Miss Beulow, or I’ll hand
you the worst thrashing you ever heard of.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You attend to your business, and I’ll attend to
mine,” was Frank’s reply. “I’ll walk with whom I
choose,” and he turned and started away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you will, will you,” shouted the now enraged
lieutenant. “Well, I’ll show you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sprang forward, and with his open palm
struck Frank a stinging blow on the side of the
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank in turn leaped forward, and the lieutenant
stepped back and placed himself in an attitude of
defense.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll have to pay for that blow,” exclaimed
Frank, “I don’t care if you are my superior officer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t let that stand in the way,” said the lieutenant
with a sneer. “I won’t hide behind that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank sprang forward to deliver a blow at his
persecutor, when his arm was seized suddenly from
behind. In vain he struggled to free himself. He
was lifted from his feet as though he had been a
child, and a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here! here! what are you fellows fighting
about?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The newcomer was Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me alone!” shouted Frank, now thoroughly
aroused. “He struck me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what if I did,” sneered the lieutenant,
“what are you doing to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll show you what I am going to do!” cried
Frank. “Let me go, Jack!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much I won’t. What chance have you with
this big bully? If he wants a row let him pitch into
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is my affair,” cried Frank, still struggling
to free himself. “Let me go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “if you must fight, all right.
But not here. Lord Hastings or Lieutenant Edwards
is liable to see you and you would both be
put under arrest.” He turned to Lieutenant Taylor.
“Are you willing to fight?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Any place and any time,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. I’ll take charge of this fight and see
that it is pulled off ship-shape. Both of you be forward
on the gun deck in half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant bowed ironically and departed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the meaning of this, anyhow?” demanded
Jack, when the two lads were alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank explained his encounter with the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you are determined to fight him?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Frank. “No man can hit me and
get away without my hitting back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But he is a great deal larger and stronger than
you are; and he is probably more proficient in the
use of his fists.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He may be and he may not,” replied Frank.
“I have taken boxing lessons and am not a novice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “it’s your funeral. But I
would rather take him on myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may have a chance at some other date,”
said Frank, and the two made their way to the
spot designated for the fight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Word that there was going to be a fistic battle
spread quickly among the crew, and there was a
stampede forward on the gun deck. The British
sailor loves nothing better than a fist fight, and the
news that the encounter was to be between officers
added to the enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c004'>Since coming aboard Frank and Jack had come
to be great favorites with the men, while Lieutenant
Taylor, because of his arrogant attitude, was
cordially disliked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Less than twenty minutes later, Lieutenant Taylor,
still with a sneer on his face, arrived.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, listen! I am going to run this show,”
declared Jack. “And what I say goes. Is that
right, men?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cries of “Right you are,” and “You bet,” came
from all sides.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This thing has got to be pulled off without
noise,” Jack continued; “so I must ask you to refrain
from applauding. Is that satisfactory?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O. K. Jack,” came the reply from some. “You’re
the boy!” and “Run it to suit yourself” from others.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, then,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a piece of chalk he drew a square on the
deck, twenty feet each way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fighting must be done in this ring,” he declared,
“Marquis of Queensbury rules, and no hitting
in the clinches. Ten three-minute rounds, with
a minute’s rest between rounds. This is going to
be a square fight, because I am going to referee it.
The first man to break one of these rules will have
me to contend with, and he will have a big job on
his hands.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A subdued laugh ran along the line of sailor
spectators.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good for you, Jack,” came the cries. “You’re
the boy! Tell ’em what’s what!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now for seconds,” continued Jack. “Thomas,
you will go to Chadwick’s corner. I don’t like to
impose upon anyone, so I shall call for volunteers.
Who will second the lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a moment’s silence, then an old sailor
in the rear of the crowd pushed his way forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think much of the job,” he said, “but
somebody has got to do it. I guess I’m the victim.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” said Jack. “Now get your men to
their corners.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As the two combatants divested themselves of
their coats and vests, and turned up their shirt
sleeves to the elbow, it seemed to the spectators that
the battle was bound to be one-sided.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor, tall and broad, topped his opponent
by several inches. His hands were big and
his arms muscular. Beside him Frank looked frail
indeed.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, Frank’s light weight gave him some
advantage over the lieutenant, for the latter’s size
greatly impeded his activity, while Frank was as
quick on his feet as a cat.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length the combatants stood ready in their
corners. Jack advanced to the center of the ring,
and called the two to him. Standing between them,
he repeated his instructions; then, not asking them
to shake hands, he skipped nimbly from between
them, and shouted:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Time!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />THE FIGHT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The lieutenant came forward with a leap, and
aimed a smashing blow at Frank’s head. Retreating
swiftly, the lad jerked back his head with a
quick move, and the blow fell short by an eyelash.
It was a pretty move, and the crowd of spectators
acknowledged it with subdued exclamations of delight.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant was thrown off his balance by
the force of his blow, but Frank did not take advantage
of the opening, contenting himself with
remaining on guard. He knew that if one of those
sledge-hammer blows should land, it would probably
end the contest once and for all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dumb luck!” exclaimed the crestfallen lieutenant,
as he pressed forward again, “but I’ll get you
next time!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank smiled quietly. This seemed to enrage
the lieutenant, and he made a sudden rush forward,
casting science to the winds. He aimed a vicious
blow at Frank, but the lad side-stepped neatly, and
as the lieutenant, carried forward by the force of
the blow, passed him, there was a sharp “spat” as
Frank’s right fist found its mark behind the lieutenant’s ear.</p>

<p class='c004'>The blow was a light one and did no damage
save to make Lieutenant Taylor’s wrath greater.
Turning, he charged again, and this time Frank did
not retreat. He warded off a series of terrific blows
with a perfect guard, but so swiftly did they rain
in on him that he had no opportunity to counter.
Again the lieutenant bored in. Suddenly Frank
stepped inside the other’s guard, left open because
of his wild swings, and delivered a stinging blow to
the point of the chin. The lieutenant staggered
back, and, as he did so, time was called for the first
round.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty work, my boy,” exclaimed Frank’s second,
as the lad returned to his corner. “You had him
going that time. But he’ll cool off between rounds,
so you want to be careful. Better stay on the defensive
for a few rounds and tire him a bit. One
of those wild swings is liable to land, and, if it did,
it would be good night for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” replied Frank. “That is good advice,
and I shall heed it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The two advanced to the center of the ring for
the second round.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good work, get him this time, boy; watch out
for his swings,” came the advice from the crowd.</p>

<p class='c004'>But this time the lieutenant was more careful.
He had learned that this opponent, whom he had
held so lightly, was no novice, and that he had power
behind his blows. Therefore he gave up his whirlwind
attack, and for two minutes the combatants
stood face to face and sparred. Gradually the lieutenant
moved forward and Frank retreated slowly.
He had adopted a waiting policy. He was trying
to tire his opponent out. The round ended without
a severe blow being struck.</p>

<p class='c004'>The third and fourth rounds were a repetition of
the second. But the lieutenant, tiring of this, began
the fifth with a rush. As before, Frank retreated
before him, and, after backing twice around the
ring, the lieutenant suddenly launched a terrific blow
at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>In leaping back, Frank tripped, and, in trying to
regain his balance, left his guard open. Quick to
take advantage of this misfortune, Lieutenant Taylor
sprang forward and aimed another vicious blow.
At this moment Frank regained his balance, but he
was unable to avoid the blow, which caught him
with stunning force on the jaw.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad reeled, staggered back, and fell to the
floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five,” counted Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the count of six, Frank raised himself to his
knees, and at nine staggered to his feet. By a great
effort he avoided the lieutenant’s blow and staggered
into a clinch. A moment later time was called.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank’s second was in the ring in an instant and
dragged the lad quickly to his corner, where he did
all in his power to revive him before time was again
called.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He thinks he’s got you now,” he whispered. “If
you can stall through this round, you will be all
right. Clinch, and hang on tight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the opposite corner Lieutenant Taylor sat with
a sneering smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll end it this round,” he told himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>When time was called for the sixth round Frank
rushed desperately into a clinch. Each moment his
head became clearer, and he grew stronger. He
clinched time after time and succeeded in going
through the round without punishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through the seventh and eighth round Frank
continued to fight off his opponent, not attempting
to strike a blow himself. The opening of the ninth
round found the lad himself again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has had it all his own way too long,” he told
himself. “It’s time for me to get busy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more the lieutenant came forward with a
rush. But this time, instead of stepping backward,
Frank, warding off the lieutenant’s right, stepped
inside the other’s guard, and delivered a sharp,
short-arm jab to his opponent’s jaw. The lieutenant
hesitated a moment, and the lad, following up his
advantage, sent his left to his opponent’s stomach.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he stepped back and the lieutenant came in
again. Feinting with his left, Frank sent his right
fist crashing into the lieutenant’s sore jaw, and the
latter gave ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank followed him closely, delivering a series of
right- and left-handed hooks at close range. The
lieutenant, apparently bewildered at this whirlwind
attack, after having had it all his own way so long,
continued to retreat around the ring.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, suddenly, he lowered his head, and rushed
like an enraged bull straight at the lad. Frank
stepped quickly to one side, and struck out straight
from the shoulder. The blow landed flush upon
the lieutenant’s chin, and he fell sprawling clear
across the ring.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hooray, hooray!” came the cries of the sailors.
“You got him that time!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But, as Jack counted four, time was called again,
and the lieutenant was saved.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get him this time, Frank!” cried the spectators,
as the two advanced to the center of the ring for the
last round. The lieutenant was very shaky, but his
second had worked over him hard, and he was in a
position to go on with the fight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank gave him no time to rest. He bored in
rapidly, keeping his guard steady the while, that no
chance blow might break through, and staggered
his opponent time after time with jabs, hooks and
long-range blows.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant gave back steadily before him and
Frank followed up his advantage swiftly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the lieutenant seemed to recover himself,
and stepped forward in a final desperate effort to
end the battle; and for a moment the two stood toe
to toe and exchanged blows. Frank emerged from
this struggle at close quarters second best, his face
streaming with blood.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the lieutenant’s blows had lost their force,
and though the lad’s face was a sight, he was not
badly hurt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Frank stepped forward, and, brushing
aside the other’s guard, struck him a hard left-handed
blow over the heart. The lieutenant reeled,
and before he could recover his balance Frank
crossed his right to the lieutenant’s face.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a resounding “smack,” followed by a
heavy fall, as Lieutenant Taylor, struck flush upon
the point of the chin, was lifted from his feet, and
measured his length upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“&mdash;&mdash;Eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten&mdash;out!” counted Jack; and
the sailors surged in and lifted Frank to their shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later Lieutenant Taylor stirred, then
arose slowly to his feet. Even as he did so, the
sounds of hilarity on the gun deck were stilled by a
harsh voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant Taylor! Mr. Chadwick! To your
quarters immediately! You may consider yourselves
under arrest. Such disgraceful proceedings
will not be tolerated on the <i>Sylph</i> while I am in
command!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning, Jack and Frank beheld the stern countenance
of Lord Hastings.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />THE GAME IS OPENED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The crowd of sailors disappeared as if by magic,
and Frank, Jack and Lieutenant Taylor found themselves
alone with Lord Hastings. The latter said
no further word, and, without attempting to speak,
Frank and his vanquished adversary made their
way from the gun deck to their cabins. Jack followed
a moment later, after waiting in vain for
some other word from Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank greeted his friend’s arrival with a sickly
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like I was in for it, doesn’t it?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does,” was the reply. “Now, if you had
taken my advice&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t preach,” Frank broke in. “Anyhow, there
is no use crying over spilt milk. I shall have to
take my medicine. What do you suppose Lord
Hastings will do with me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t the slightest idea. But say,” and Jack
grew enthusiastic, “that was some scrap you put
up. I didn’t know you were a fighter. Why didn’t
you tell me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I only did my best,” replied Frank modestly. “I
thought he had me two or three times.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was afraid so, too. But, if he had beaten you,
I would have given him a good licking myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What? How about the advice you gave me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, that’s different,” said Jack, in some confusion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see it is. Now, under the same circumstances,
you would have done just as I did, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack smiled somewhat sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess I should,” was his reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance
of a sailor, who announced that Lord Hastings
desired their presence in his cabin immediately.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, here’s where I learn my fate,” said Frank,
as he went on deck, followed by Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings was writing when the boys entered
his cabin. He looked up, motioned them to a
seat with a nod, and resumed his work. A moment
later Lieutenant Taylor came in, and was also motioned
to a seat. Finally, Lord Hastings wheeled
about in his chair and spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You,” he said, indicating Frank and the lieutenant,
“have broken one of the most stringent
rules of the naval manual. What have you to say
in justification of your actions?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing, sir,” replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank remained silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The least punishment I should mete out,”
continued Lord Hastings, “is to confine you both to
your quarters indefinitely. But we are somewhat
short-handed now. If you will give me your words
that there will be no repetition of this disgraceful
scene, I shall suspend punishment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For my part, I promise gladly,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings turned toward Lieutenant Taylor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The little whelp insulted me,” exclaimed the
lieutenant. “I shall make no promises, unless he
is kept out of my way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, sir,” replied Lord Hastings. “Remain
in your cabin until you receive further orders.
You may go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, your lordship&mdash;&mdash;” protested the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a word, sir!” exclaimed Lord Hastings.
“Return to your cabin immediately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant saluted and left the cabin. Hardly
had he taken his departure when there was a sudden
change in Lord Hastings’ manner. He rose to
his feet, advanced across the cabin and took Frank
by the hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was a great fight!” he exclaimed with
enthusiasm. “It did me good to see you polish off
that traitor. I would have liked to be in your
place!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank was taken by surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know, I know,” cried Lord Hastings, raising
a protesting hand. “It’s against the rules and regulations
and should merit punishment. But there
are extenuating circumstances. It has worked out
beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What, sir?” demanded Jack, who had remained
silent up to this time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, Taylor is disposed of for the time being.
He will not dare to leave his quarters, and in the
meantime we can go about our plans without fear
of interruption. We can get rid of Hardy without
arousing his suspicions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I am not to be punished, sir?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not this time,” was the reply. “But don’t let it
happen again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t, sir,” Frank promised.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way,” said Lord Hastings, as the lads
turned to leave the cabin. “It may interest you to
know that to-morrow we shall join the fleet off
Helgoland. I have already been in communication
with Admiral Jellicoe, and he approves of our plan.
It must be carried out to-day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” exclaimed Frank and Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” continued Lord Hastings. He extended
a slip of paper to Frank. “Give this to the wireless
operator,” and he added, with a smile: “Then make
sure there is no one near the wireless room&mdash;except
Hardy. He must overhear this message, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The boys saluted and left the cabin. Frank
glanced at the message.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does it say?” demanded Jack eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank read aloud:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Safe to send half of fleet to Baltic to-morrow
night. Order submarine and several destroyers
close into Helgoland at same time&mdash;this to make
imminent attack apparent, so enemy may not learn
of other move and attack in force.&mdash;<span class='sc'>Hastings.</span>”</p>

<p class='c004'>The message placed in the hands of the operator,
the boys returned to their own cabin. As they
made their way along the deck they saw Hardy
loitering near the wireless room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll hear it, all right,” said Jack, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you construe that message?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” replied Jack, “let’s see if we can’t figure
it out. Say the Germans, having been furnished
with the text of the message&mdash;fake though it is&mdash;believe
half the British fleet has started for the
Baltic. They will figure that their own strong fleet
can easily destroy the remaining half of our fleet.
Therefore, when they believe it has been divided,
they will attack. Lured from beneath the
protection of the heavy shore guns, we shall make short
work of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I figure that the submarine and destroyers will
approach nearer the port to flash word of the German
advance. Besides, their appearance will further
strengthen the belief of the Germans that half
of the fleet has sailed&mdash;particularly in view of the
false message, for it would be the natural thing to
do if half the fleet really were going away, as it
would keep the Germans from attacking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see what you mean,” declared Frank. “And I
guess that is the way Lord Hastings has figured it
out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sure of it,” was the reply. “But come on
deck, and let’s see if we can see what use Hardy
will make of the information he has obtained.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Moving stealthily along the deck, the lads saw
the sailor making his way toward Lieutenant Taylor’s
cabin. There he slipped a piece of paper
through the window. Then he loitered near.</p>

<p class='c004'>There came a slight tapping on the window, and
the sailor again approached it. The boys heard the
lieutenant’s voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is time to act,” he said. “It has come sooner
than I expected. Return in half an hour, and I
will have prepared the message you must send the
Germans.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy slunk away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We must report this to Lord Hastings at once,”
exclaimed Frank. “Come!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads rushed to the commander’s cabin, where
they told him what they had overheard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” said Lord Hastings. “Now, listen to
me carefully. We are in easy communication with
the British fleet, and also with the Germans, by
wireless. Watch Taylor’s cabin, and, as soon as
he passes the message to Hardy, you order the wireless
operator to report to me at once. Then hide.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I give this order for two reasons: First, I do
not want the operator hurt, and second, Hardy
must be allowed to send the message to the Germans
without molestation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lads saluted and left the cabin. They took
their stand close to the wireless cabin, but still commanded
a view of Lieutenant Taylor’s quarters.
Here they waited.</p>

<p class='c004'>Their patience was at length rewarded. Hardy
again approached the lieutenant’s cabin, and received
a slip of paper through the window.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now to get the operator away,” exclaimed
Frank, and moved toward the wireless room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The operator left the room at their orders, and
the two boys disappeared just as the sailor approached
the wireless station. The lads saw him
enter the cabin. Then they went to make their
report to Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good!” exclaimed the latter. “Mr. Templeton,
inform Lieutenant Taylor that I have countermanded
the order confining him to his cabin. Order
him to return to his duties!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />A CONFESSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>All day the <i>Sylph</i> continued on her course without
interruption. Frank spent several hours strolling
about the deck with Miss Beulow, and he experienced
no further trouble with Lieutenant Taylor,
although the latter passed them twice, each
time gazing at the boy threateningly.</p>

<p class='c004'>While at supper the wireless operator entered the
cabin and approached Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have picked up the cruiser <i>Alto</i>, sir,” he said.
“She will pass us in the morning on her way to
Copenhagen. Also I have a message from the Admiralty
ordering us to join the fleet at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The operator departed and Lord Hastings turned
to Miss Beulow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Beulow,” he said, “I have decided to transfer
you to the cruiser to-morrow, so you may return
to your mother in Copenhagen. We are likely
to go into action at any time, and this is no place
for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl nodded in assent, although she declared
that she was not afraid of being in battle.</p>

<p class='c004'>As she strolled about the deck alone, some hours
later, she was accosted by Lieutenant Taylor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sorry I seem to be objectionable to you,”
said the lieutenant; “but now I would ask that you
give me a few moments in private. I have something
important to say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl hesitated a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well,” she said at length, and the lieutenant
led the way to a secluded spot aft.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Beulow,” began the lieutenant, “although
you are half American, your sympathies are with
the German cause, are they not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How can you ask that question, when you are
aware that my father is a German?” responded the
girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I just wanted to make sure. I am right, am I
not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You most certainly are,” replied the girl emphatically.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. Now you seem to dislike me. Would
you look upon me with more favor if I were to
espouse the German cause?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl looked at him in great surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you think less harshly of me if I were
to strike a blow for Germany?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl stared at him, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What would you say if I were to tell you it is
in my power to destroy the British fleet off Helgoland?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl took a step backward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is impossible!” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!” cried the lieutenant, now carried away.
“It is not impossible. It is true! And, what is
more, I shall do it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You to say this to me! You, an Englishman!”
exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is Great Britain to me?” he said. “I am
an American.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you are an officer in the English navy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“True; but for a purpose. I hold a commission
as captain in the German regular army.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can hardly credit it,” exclaimed Miss Beulow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nevertheless it is true. Now, when I have succeeded
in my strategy&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strategy!” cried the girl. “It is treachery!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Call it what you will,” replied the lieutenant.
“When I have succeeded in delivering the British
fleet into the hands of the Germans, will you then
look with more favor upon me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl recoiled from him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!” she cried. “No! I wish never to see you
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do not decide hastily,” said the lieutenant. He
drew from his pocket a slip of paper. “Here is the
message I sent to the German admiral at Helgoland,
the message that means the destruction of half the
British fleet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Wonderingly the girl took the slip of paper from
him and read. It was the message prepared by
Lord Hastings, to which was added the postscript
that this was the message sent the commander of
the British fleet. It bore no signature, although
addressed to the German admiral.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall keep this,” said Miss Beulow, and she
folded it up and placed it in a small purse she carried.
Then she started to move away, but the lieutenant
detained her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait,” he commanded. “You have not answered
my question satisfactorily as yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I never will!” cried the girl. “I wish nothing
to do with traitors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook off his detaining hand and fled down
the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What shall I do?” she asked herself. “I cannot
betray my country’s plans&mdash;and yet Lord Hastings
should be told of this treachery.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She paced up and down the deck for almost an
hour; then she sought an interview with the commander
of the <i>Sylph</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord Hastings,” she said, “suppose a person
knew something that, if he told, would defeat the
plans of the country he calls his own&mdash;and suppose
also that in gaining such information he learned
that treachery would encompass the defeat of his
enemy&mdash;should he tell or not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It all depends,” replied Lord Hastings, “upon
the person’s conscience. Some would say yes, and
some no. I cannot tell what I should do under the
circumstances. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl was silent for a long time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have such information,” she declared at
length; “and I do not know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings rose hastily from his seat, approached
and laid his hand upon her arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say no more,” he said. “I know that which
you have on your mind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?” cried the girl in great surprise. “It is
impossible that you should know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nevertheless I do know,” replied Lord Hastings.
“Let that suffice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But how can that be?” exclaimed the girl. “No,
it is not possible that you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say no more about it,” said Lord Hastings
gently. “It is not your duty to tell me anything
that would work to the disadvantage of your country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Beulow bowed her head and left the cabin
without another word.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings hastily summoned Frank, and to
him related what had just occurred.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is plain,” he said, “that Taylor has told his
plans to Miss Beulow. If she should repeat to him
what I have just said to her, it would put him on
his guard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He must not see her, then,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is my idea exactly. Which is the reason
I have summoned you. It is your duty to see that
they are not allowed to converse together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very good, sir,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must contrive to have Taylor taken off my
hands,” mused Lord Hastings. “I do not want to
arrest him, or let him suspect that he has been discovered,
for he may be of more use to us farther
on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not send him on board the cruiser with
Miss Beulow to-morrow, then, giving him dispatches
for Copenhagen or some other point?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A good idea,” exclaimed Lord Hastings. “All
the instructions that I need give the commander
of the cruiser is to see that Taylor and the girl are
kept apart.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly, sir,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall put the plan into execution. In the meantime,
you keep your eye on the traitor, and see that
he has no chance to communicate with the girl.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank saluted and left the cabin.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />AN ACCUSATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was nearing noon the following day before
those on the <i>Sylph</i> sighted the oncoming British
cruiser <i>Alto</i>, although they had been in almost constant
wireless communication. When the cruiser
was but a short distance away, Lord Hastings summoned
Frank, Lieutenant Taylor and Alice Beulow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant Taylor,” said Lord Hastings, “you
and Mr. Chadwick will take the launch and escort
Miss Beulow aboard the cruiser. Give this,” he
continued, handing the lieutenant a paper, “to Captain
Johnson personally.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Lieutenant Taylor saluted and departed
to make the launch ready, while both the
<i>Sylph</i> and the cruiser hove to, so that the girl might
be transferred from one vessel to the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>After saying good-by all around, and thanking
Lord Hastings for his kindness, Miss Beulow took
her place in the launch. Frank and Lieutenant
Taylor followed and they were soon on their way
toward the cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the three had made their way to the launch.
Lord Hastings whispered to Frank:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant Taylor will go aboard with Miss
Beulow. Immediately he leaves the launch you
will return. The message he carries to Captain
Johnson will explain the situation to the latter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am awfully sorry to see you leaving,” said
Frank to Miss Beulow, as the launch approached
the cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I am sorry to go,” she replied. “However,
I suppose it is necessary. I hope that I shall see
you again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope so, too,” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must look me up when the war is over, if
you can,” the girl continued, and, taking a card
from her purse she wrote an address upon it and
gave it to the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank put the card carefully away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I certainly shall,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor had not spoken a word up to
this time, but Frank had caught several threatening
looks upon his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just a word of warning,” he said to Miss Beulow,
as she at last said good-by and made ready
to leave the launch. “Beware of Taylor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl smiled brightly at him, and with another
word of farewell was gone. Lieutenant Taylor,
in accordance with his instructions, followed
her aboard the cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardly had the lieutenant set foot on the deck
of the cruiser, when Frank ordered his men to put
back to the <i>Sylph</i>. As the little launch got under
way, Frank heard a shout, and, looking over his
shoulder, saw Lieutenant Taylor angrily beckoning
him to come back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait for me,” cried the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank paid no heed to this command and the
launch continued on its way. Aboard the <i>Sylph</i>
once more, Frank immediately made his way to
Lord Hastings to report. Almost at the same moment
the wireless operator rushed up and passed
the commander a slip of paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings read the message and then turned
to Lieutenant Edwards.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Full speed ahead!” he commanded. “We are
ordered to feel the way for the advance of the
British fleet against the Germans to-night. It
means we shall go into action.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurrah!” shouted Frank, unable to restrain his
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurrah!” cried Jack, who approached just in
time to catch Lord Hastings’ words.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few moments more and the <i>Sylph</i> was again
dashing madly through the water. But hardly was
the vessel under way when the wireless operator,
his face flushed and his manner manifesting the
greatest excitement, rushed up to Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sir!” he cried to the commander of the vessel,
“Miss Beulow has been accused by Lieutenant Taylor
and arrested on the <i>Alto</i> as a German spy!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” shouted Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Arrested!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” replied the operator. “I just this
moment received the message.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come with me,” commanded Lord Hastings,
and the three made a rush for the wireless room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Just as they neared the room, the form of a
man emerged hastily from the door, and, noting
their approach, ran hurriedly along the deck. Paying
no heed to the disappearing man, the three ran
into the room. Here Lord Hastings dashed off a
message, which he handed to the operator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Send this!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>The message read:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Release the girl. Arrest Lieutenant Taylor.
He is the spy. Explanation follows.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The operator took his place beside his instrument,
but, after one touch of the key, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is dead!” he cried. “Somebody has tampered
with it in my absence!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” exclaimed Lord Hastings excitedly, then
added more coolly. “What is the matter with it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t tell yet, sir. I shall have to look it
over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then do so at once!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank and Lord Hastings remained quiet while
the operator sought to determine the cause of the
trouble.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally the operator stood up and faced them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s no use, sir,” he said. “The whole apparatus
is out of commission. It can’t be repaired in less
than twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impossible!” cried Lord Hastings. “It must be
repaired. That message must be sent!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sorry, sir,” replied the operator, “but it is
utterly impossible to repair the damage in less than
the time I have mentioned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings was silent for some moments.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well,” he said at length. “Do the best you
can.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned on his heel, and made his way to his
cabin. Frank followed him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But what will happen to Miss Beulow, sir?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid,” was the reply, “that she is in great
danger of being shot!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shot!” Frank stood aghast at the word.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” was the reply, “as she has been arrested,
she will probably be tried by an impromptu court-martial
at once. If convicted, she will be sentenced
to die.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But we can save her,” cried Frank. “The <i>Sylph</i>
is fast; she can overtake the cruiser. Shall I give
the order at once, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sorry,” replied Lord Hastings slowly, “but
it cannot be done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cannot be done? Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We have been ordered into action. We must
obey. One life cannot be allowed to stand in the
way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;” Frank stammered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings did not reply, but instead arose
and summoned Lieutenant Edwards.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Arrest the sailor Hardy immediately and have
him confined in irons!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Edwards saluted and withdrew. Then
Lord Hastings turned to Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sorry, my boy,” he said kindly, “but there
is nothing we can do. However, the case may not
be as bad as we fear. The fact that I instructed
Captain Johnson to keep Taylor away from the
girl may arouse some suspicion in his mind and
delay a court-martial.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But there is nothing sure about it!” cried Frank.
“To think of a girl dying like that, when we are
able to save her!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings did not reply, but turned and went
on deck. Frank followed him, still imploring that
the <i>Sylph</i> be put about and return to the cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking over the water Frank could see that,
for some reason, the cruiser was stationary. She
had not continued on her course.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See,” he said to Lord Hastings, pointing, “we
could reach her in almost no time. It would not
delay us long. Will you not put about, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We have hardly time now to reach the fleet,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But&mdash;&mdash;” Frank began.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings raised a hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Further talk is useless,” he said. “I have said
it is impossible!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank’s eyes roved about the ship. Suddenly
they fell upon the little launch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am going, anyhow!” he cried, and ran toward
the launch.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />IN DIRE PERIL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When Lieutenant Taylor saw the <i>Sylph’s</i> launch
turn and head for the little vessel without waiting
for him, an expression of great surprise came over
his face, followed by one of anxiety. He raised a
shout, and, when he saw that Frank paid no heed
to him, although he knew his shout had been heard,
his suspicions were aroused.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quickly he drew from his pocket the message
Lord Hastings had ordered him to give to Captain
Johnson, and tore it in little pieces. These he
dropped into the water, and then made his way
toward the captain, who stood awaiting his approach.</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain greeted him pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have a message for me, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have, sir; and it is a most disagreeable one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Disagreeable? Has some disaster occurred?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, sir. It is even worse, if possible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Explain yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, sir. I am commanded to charge the
young lady who has just come aboard with being
a German spy!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A spy! Lord Hastings has not informed me of
this, and I have been in communication with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very true, sir, but with good reason. There are
others aboard the <i>Sylph</i> whom he did not wish to
overhear such a communication. She was seen to
steal a message relating to the movements of the
fleet from the wireless room. Also she is a German.
Lord Hastings requests that she be tried at
once!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very good, sir,” replied Captain Johnson.</p>

<p class='c004'>He called his first officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have Miss Beulow summoned here at once,” he
commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later, the young girl, smiling, stood
before them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Beulow,” said the captain, “I have an unpleasant
duty to perform. You are accused of being
a German spy!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl staggered back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who makes this absurd charge?” she demanded,
after she had to some degree regained her composure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do, at Lord Hastings’ command,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl stared at him with the greatest contempt.
Then she turned to the captain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am innocent of this charge,” she said; “but
this man,” and she pointed an accusing finger at the
lieutenant, “I know to be a spy. He is accusing me
to save himself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor smiled sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A very natural reply,” he said. “Captain, she
was seen to put the message I spoke of in her purse.
Perhaps she still has it there. Will you see for
yourself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your purse, if you please,” said Captain Johnson,
extending his hand, and speaking in a harsh
voice, for he had no reason to doubt the truth of
Lieutenant Taylor’s words.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl’s face turned white. For the first time
she realized the full seriousness of her situation.
For a moment she held her purse even closer to
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, captain,” she began, “I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your purse, if you please,” interrupted the captain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly the girl extended it to him. Quickly he
opened it, and a moment later withdrew a little
piece of paper, which he opened and read. It was
the message containing the supposed plans of the
British fleet.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a hasty perusal, the captain turned to Lieutenant
Berkeley, his first officer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Arrest her,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, captain,” exclaimed the girl in terror, “a
message to Lord Hastings will confirm the truth
of my story.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall communicate with Lord Hastings at
once,” was the reply, “but I am convinced that no
answer he can make will exonerate you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The case is perfectly plain,” agreed Lieutenant
Taylor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have this young woman confined to her cabin,”
commanded Captain Johnson to Lieutenant Berkeley,
“and have a court-martial summoned to sit at
8 o’clock in the morning. That is all. Take her
away. Now you, sir,” he continued, turning to
Lieutenant Taylor, “I suppose are to stay here to
make the charge?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly, sir,” replied the lieutenant; “such was
Lord Hastings’ command.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well. Lieutenant Berkeley will provide
you with quarters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain made his way to the wireless room,
where he had the operator pick up the <i>Sylph</i>. First
he sent a message, simply saying that Miss Beulow
had been arrested on the charge of being a spy,
the accusation having been preferred by Lieutenant
Taylor. Then he asked further details. But there
came no reply. In vain did the operator again try
to pick up the <i>Sylph</i>. At length he gave up the
attempt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is very plain,” said the captain to himself. “It
is just as Lieutenant Taylor told me. Evidently
they do not answer because they fear someone will
overhear the message.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But at that moment the wireless came to life, and
the captain waited.</p>

<p class='c004'>“From the <i>Sylph</i>?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” was the reply, “from Admiral Jellicoe.
Instead of continuing to Copenhagen, we are ordered
to cruise about in these waters, that in case a
German vessel succeeds in running the blockade,
we may be able to intercept her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” was the reply, and the commander
made his way to his own cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>For Alice Beulow, confined to her cabin, and in
full realization of her perilous situation, the day
passed slowly. Food was brought to her, but she
was not allowed to go on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>All night she paced up and down in her cabin,
and the first gleams of sunlight, streaming through
the window, found her pale and hollow-eyed. Sleep
had been impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>But eight o’clock came at last, and she was conducted
to Captain Johnson’s cabin, where around
a long table sat the men who were to try her on the
charge of being a spy&mdash;the court-martial&mdash;composed
of Captain Johnson, First Lieutenant Berkeley,
Second Lieutenant Palmer, Third Lieutenant
Emery and Fourth Lieutenant Arthur. Lieutenant
Taylor was also present.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson arose as Miss Beulow entered
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Beulow,” he said sternly, “you are accused
of being a German spy. Are you innocent or
guilty?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am innocent,” replied the girl quietly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson motioned her to a seat, then
turned to Lieutenant Taylor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may state your case, sir,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor arose and bowed to the members
of the court-martial. Then he faced the young
girl, a slight sneer on his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, lying was not the least of the lieutenant’s
accomplishments, and he told a plausible story to
the officers who sat as judges. He told of how
Lord Hastings had learned, through great good
fortune, that there were German spies on board
the <i>Sylph</i>, and how, after being saved from a watery
grave, Miss Beulow had repaid her saviours by
joining in the conspiracy against them.</p>

<p class='c004'>He related how Lord Hastings had set a trap
for the plotters, and how Miss Beulow had been
caught red-handed stealing a message from the
wireless room. She had not been arrested then, he
explained, because the identity of the other conspirators
had not been learned, and it was feared
that her arrest would make them more wary.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was indeed a plausible story, and the judges
were plainly impressed with it. Not a doubt of the
lieutenant’s honesty and veracity had entered the
mind of a single member of the court-martial.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length the lieutenant finished and resumed his
seat; and the accused girl arose to face her judges,
whom, she was now certain, would also be her executioners.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you wish to make a statement?” she was
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do,” was her reply, as she stood trembling and
on the verge of tears, and she continued: “I solemnly
swear I am innocent of this grave charge.
It is true my father is a German, but that does not
prove I am a spy. I accuse that man there,” and
she pointed a trembling finger at Lieutenant Taylor,
“of conspiring to destroy the British fleet!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor sprang to his feet angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Absurd!” he cried, and sat down again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it not true?” continued the young girl, facing
him steadily, “that you are not an Englishman?
Is it not true that you are an American?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what of that?” exclaimed the lieutenant.
“I am nevertheless an officer in the British navy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl turned from him and faced her judges
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Gentlemen,” she said, “that man came to me
two nights ago and declared to me that he was a
captain in the German army, and that he was plotting
the destruction of the English fleet off Helgoland.
He thought that because I am a German,
and because I had ignored him, that he could gain
my sympathy by disclosing his reason for being
with the English. He told me his plans. He, not
I, is the traitor!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How,” he asked, “do you account for the paper
I found in your possession?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant Taylor showed it to me,” replied
the girl. “He said it was the message that meant
the destruction of the British fleet. He gave it to
me and I kept it. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I deny it!” exclaimed Lieutenant Taylor, springing
to his feet</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson waved him aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you anything else to say. Miss Beulow?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing,” replied the girl, “except that I am
innocent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may return to your cabin, Miss Beulow,”
said Captain Johnson. “You shall know our verdict
as soon as we have reached it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Haltingly the girl was escorted back to her cabin.
Here, at length, she gave way to her feelings and
burst into tears. When, finally, she was again summoned
before the court-martial, she had regained
her composure, and, dry-eyed, and standing firmly
erect, she once more calmly faced her judges, to
learn from them whether she was to live or die.</p>

<p class='c004'>The captain and all other members of the court-martial
arose from their seats.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Beulow,” said Captain Johnson, in a gruff
voice, “we have found you, after due deliberation,
to be guilty of the charge against you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Alice Beulow staggered back, and the captain
stopped speaking. The British commander cleared
his voice of a huskiness that had crept into it, pulled
himself together, and continued firmly:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the sentence of this court-martial is that
you be shot to-morrow morning at eight o’clock!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />“THE BOY ADMIRAL.”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>As Frank announced his intention of going alone
to save Alice Beulow from the death of a spy, he
sprang across the deck in the direction of the little
launch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings jumped quickly after him, and
Jack, who had stood silently nearby, during the
conversation, also gave chase. Except for these
three, the deck in this part of the vessel was unoccupied.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Frank reached the rail, Jack grabbed him by
the arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t be a fool!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chadwick!” cried Lord Hastings, hurrying
up, “return to your quarters immediately!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank shook off Jack’s detaining hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me alone!” he shouted. “Do you think I
am going to stand idle while an innocent girl is
put to death!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again Jack took his friend by the arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stop! Think what you are about!” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know what I’m about!” cried Frank angrily.
“Let me go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not by a long shot!” exclaimed Jack, “If I
have to hold you I will!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chadwick!” commanded Lord Hastings, “I
am commander of this vessel, and I order you to go
to your quarters at once!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I refuse!” cried the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What! You disobey your commander!” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied Frank, “when it means the death
of an innocent girl. And I am surprised to see you
stand by idly!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t lost my senses,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” was Frank’s answer, “but you seem to
have lost your nerve!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack released his hold on his friend and stepped
back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” he exclaimed, “do you mean I am a
coward?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know what I mean!” cried the now furious
lad, “but it looks like it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Enough of this!” spoke Lord Hastings. “Mr.
Chadwick! For the last time I order you to return
to your quarters!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t do it!” cried Frank, and drew closer
to the rail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings drew a revolver.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know that I would be perfectly justified
in shooting you?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shoot, then!” cried Frank. “I am going anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings drew back in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know what you are doing?” he asked.
“Do you know that quitting your ship in the face of
action is worse than cowardice? That it is desertion?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank was taken aback.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings saw that he had made a point, and
pressed it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chadwick!” he exclaimed. “Frank! You
are trying to desert!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank took a step forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Desert!” he muttered huskily. “No, I won’t
desert!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned on his heel, and, without another
word, rushed headlong to his cabin, where he
threw himself down on his bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Frank made his way to his cabin, Jack wiped
beads of perspiration from his brow, as he muttered
to Lord Hastings:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was afraid he would not come to his senses.
I was afraid I should have to use force, and Frank
is not one to give up without a fight. I am just as
greatly alarmed at Miss Beulow’s predicament as
he is, but I know my duty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I am glad you do,” replied Lord Hastings.
“Fond as I am of the boy, I should not have allowed
him to go. I should even have shot him had
it been necessary. Discipline must be maintained at
all hazards. I will countenance no disobedience!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack drew back in surprise. This was a new
side of Lord Hastings. Heretofore he had always
been the best-natured fellow imaginable. But he
was plainly very angry now.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack saluted and turned to move away. Lord
Hastings halted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell Mr. Chadwick to report to me in half an
hour,” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Jack, as he made his
way to his cabin. “He can get awfully mad. I
can hardly believe it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank arose from his bed as Jack entered the
cabin, and approached his friend with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess I made an awful fool of myself,” he exclaimed;
“and I called you a coward. I want to
apologize. You know I didn’t mean it, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course,” replied Jack, grasping his friend’s
hand. “You were angry; that was all. Say no
more about it By the way. Lord Hastings wants
to see you in half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?” exclaimed Frank, in no little alarm.
“Was he mad?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was he mad! I should say he was! I don’t
know what he wants, though.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “I guess I am big enough
to take my medicine without crying. But I wish
something might be done for Miss Beulow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I,” replied Jack. “But cheer up. It may
not be as bad as we think. Besides, I suppose we
shall go into action to-night. After the battle, we
can manage to get hold of the <i>Alto</i> in some manner,
and matters can be explained then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it’s not too late,” exclaimed Frank fearfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It just can’t be too late,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later Frank stood before Lord
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first thing I want to impress upon you,”
said Lord Hastings, “is the necessity of obedience
and discipline. Those qualifications are essential.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sorry I acted as I did, sir,” replied Frank,
“but I was greatly wrought up. I apologize, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings’ manner underwent a sudden
change.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know you were, my boy,” he said, “and I
forgive you. I don’t know but that I should have
done the same when I was no older than you are.
But I have learned with age.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, sir,” replied the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I promise you,” said Lord Hastings, “that immediately
the battle is over I shall look into Miss
Beulow’s case. I am sure no harm will come to
her before that time. Now, I have a little surprise
for you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A surprise, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes; I am going aboard Admiral Jellicoe’s flagship
when we join the fleet this evening. How
would you and Jack like to go with me? We shall
dine with the admiral.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean it, sir?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course. We shall probably outline our plans
for the coming battle, and I am sure you would like
to be there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure Jack and I shall both be pleased, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right; you may go now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank hurried back to his cabin, where he informed
Jack of Lord Hastings’ plan.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great!” exclaimed the latter. “I have heard a
great deal about Admiral Jellicoe. And, if I mistake
not, the whole world will have heard of him
before this war is over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was mid-afternoon when the first vessel of the
great English fleet was raised off Helgoland; and
it was well after nightfall when the <i>Sylph</i>, after
making her way through the great armada, came
to anchor near the flagship, of Vice-Admiral Jellicoe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon one of the <i>Sylph’s</i> small boats was lowered
and manned, and Lord Hastings, Frank and Jack
jumped into it. Aboard the flagship, the meeting
of Admiral Jellicoe and Lord Hastings did not wait
on ceremony.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were too old friends for such formalities.
As Lord Hastings reached the deck of the flagship,
Admiral Jellicoe rushed forward to meet him. The
greeting was affectionate, and, after some few
words, Lord Hastings motioned to Frank and Jack
to approach.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish to present to your excellency,” said Lord
Hastings, in introducing the two lads to the British
naval commander, “two of the bravest and most
resourceful young men it has ever been my fortune
to encounter. They both are midshipmen aboard
my vessel.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Both lads bowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am pleased to meet you, sirs,” acknowledged
Admiral Jellicoe, and led the way to his cabin, Lord
Hastings, Jack, Frank and officers following.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this was the boys’ introduction to Vice-Admiral
Sir John Jellicoe, Great Britain’s “Boy Admiral,”
the youngest Briton holding such an important
command&mdash;the man to whom, soon after
war with Germany was declared, Winston Churchill,
first lord of the Admiralty, sent this laconic
message:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Capture or destroy the German fleet!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />THE BATTLE AT SEA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was shortly before dawn the following morning&mdash;August
28th, to be exact&mdash;that two British
submarines, taking care to keep clear of the mines
which had been planted outside the harbor of Helgoland,
crept in close to the island. A little farther
out, screened by the darkness which is always greatest
just before dawn, the light cruiser, <i>Fearless</i>,
took her position to await results.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alongside the <i>Fearless</i>, but hidden from view by
the larger vessel, lay the <i>Sylph</i>&mdash;to which our two
boys had returned late that night&mdash;ready at an instant’s
notice to act as scout or carry dispatches.
All aboard were on the alert, and, as Frank and
Jack leaned over the rail, awaiting anxiously the
first glimmer of daylight, their excitement was intense.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly the gray dawn approached and the first
light disclosed the two submarines well inland, but
apparently in distress. One of them seemed to have
been disabled, and the other was standing by as
though to give aid.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both boys watched eagerly for the development
of the strategy, details of which were known to
every officer on the <i>Sylph</i>. They had not long to
wait, for the German lookouts had been quick to
note the seemingly crippled condition of the submarine.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was also evident from the movement of the
German torpedo craft that they, too, had discovered
the <i>Fearless</i>, for these swift destroyers were speedily
put in motion, some heading for the submarines,
while others started toward the <i>Fearless</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perceiving that the ruse was working, the <i>Fearless</i>
put on full speed and turned to the northwest.
The <i>Sylph</i> followed her example, and the two boats
sped away with the Germans in full chase.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile, the Germans were getting their first
surprise. Having filled their tanks, the submarines
quickly disappeared beneath the waves.</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking backward, the boys could see what had
happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope they don’t suspect what we are doing,”
said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should think they would,” replied Jack. “I
should think anybody could see it was a ruse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is because you know all about it,” laughed
his companion. “If you did not, you would do
just exactly what the Germans are doing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words had scarcely left his lips when there
was a flash from the pursuing torpedo boats, quickly
followed by others, and the shells began to fly over
and about the <i>Fearless</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then it was that the <i>Fearless</i> replied, and that
her fire was effective was quickly discovered. But,
while it could be seen that the pursuers were repeatedly
hit, they were not disabled, and seemed
determined to capture the little cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now came a surprise. Out of the gray mist
of morning there appeared a flotilla of British
destroyers&mdash;nearly two dozen in all&mdash;accompanied
by the new light armored cruiser <i>Arethusa</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the portholes of each vessel were flashes
thick and fast, and the shells and solid shot began
to scream through the air. Almost before they
knew it, and certainly before they had time to realize
how matters stood, the German torpedo flotilla
was hotly engaged by the fresh arrivals.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was very evident that the British reinforcements
were greatly superior in every way, and
the Germans were getting the worst of it when,
from out the harbor, came swiftly several light
German cruisers, rushing to the support of their
small craft.</p>

<p class='c004'>Almost sooner than it can be told the two fleets
were close enough together to use every available
gun; and for the next few minutes pandemonium
reigned.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gun-laying of all the British ships was splendid,
and soon the Germans began to show by their
rent funnels, splintered upper works and damaged
hulls the punishment they were receiving. Almost
together, two shells from 10-inch guns struck the
<i>Arethusa</i>. One plowed its way through the upper
decks, doing great damage, while the other found
its way into the engine-room. There was a terrific
explosion, and the steam poured from the portholes
and mingled with the smoke of battle.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the <i>Arethusa</i> never deviated from her course
nor ceased her terrible fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>A minute later a solid shot entered the bow of
the <i>Sylph</i>, tore its way diagonally across the gun
deck, and put one of the 6-inch rifles out of commission.
Another struck the bridge, smashed the
funnel, and killed the man at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Unmindful of the shot and shell flying about,
Jack sprang from his station in the wheel house
and grabbed the wheel in time to prevent the <i>Sylph</i>
from colliding with the <i>Laertes</i>, one of the swiftest
of the torpedo boats, which had also been severely
damaged, but was making a fierce running fight.</p>

<p class='c004'>After some ten minutes of running and fighting,
the <i>Fearless</i>, which was leading the flotilla, turned
sharply to the west, followed by the remainder of
the smaller craft. As the flotilla came around, two
of the enemy’s cruisers could be seen in a half-sinking
condition, and two of the destroyers were
missing, having been sunk.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up to this instant the battle had been fought at
very close range, and the dozen or more German
cruisers seemed to be rapidly overhauling the mosquito
fleet; but, with the sudden turning of the
little squadron to the west, there came the single
boom of a great gun from out the northwest, heralding
the approach of the British battleships&mdash;magnificent
vessels of the First Battle Squadron.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the great British guns opened upon the enemy,
the Germans turned to flee; but it was too late.
They had been lured too far into the open. British
strategy had proved too much for the Teutonic
mind. Badly battered by the terrific and accurate
fire of the British, the Germans turned, and, as
fast as their numerous wounds would allow, ran
for Helgoland.</p>

<p class='c004'>Above the sharp banging of the smaller guns,
came the great booms from the giant British battleships.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly one of the enemy’s cruisers, the <i>Köln</i>,
burst into a brilliant sheet of flame. A shell had
exploded in her boiler-room. There was a terrible
explosion, and the vessel seemed to leap into the
air like a live thing of fire, only to disappear beneath
the water with a great hiss a moment later.</p>

<p class='c004'>A great British cheer rang out across the water;
and the Germans, if possible, fled faster than before.
Evidently the Germans had expected assistance
from the remainder of the fleet, which had been so
long bottled up in Helgoland; but no help came.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of the fact that the German vessels under
the protection of the great guns of the fort were
undoubtedly ready for instant action, the order for
them to sally forth to the assistance of their comrades
came not.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gradually the German ships drew off, pursued
for a great distance by the victorious British fleet,
leaving four vessels at the bottom of the North Sea,
two others burning, and, with practically every vessel
that had been engaged in the action suffering
serious damage. British marksmanship had been
too much for them, and they retired to the protection
of the great guns of Helgoland, till they presently
should once more summon sufficient courage
to face the British.</p>

<p class='c004'>The loss of the Germans was enormous&mdash;that
of the English comparatively light, only thirty-two
lives lost, and less than sixty men wounded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several of the British ships had been struck by
German shells, but all were able to steam away,
although for a short time the <i>Arethusa</i> received
some aid from the <i>Sylph</i>. The <i>Liberty</i> also had
been seriously damaged.</p>

<p class='c004'>While the smaller guns of the <i>Sylph</i> had prevented
her from working any great damage on the
heavily armored German vessels, the little scout
cruiser had, nevertheless, been right in the hottest
of the fight. One of her men was killed and three
were wounded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A gallant fight!” declared Lord Hastings to his
officers, as the <i>Sylph</i> drew off after the battle.
“England may well be proud of her sailors!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was glorious!” replied Frank. “But I am
sorry we did not have a more important part to
play.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And so am I,” declared Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t let that worry you,” replied Lord Hastings.
“You will see all the fighting you want, and
more too before the war is over, or I miss my
guess.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack, “to-day’s action has proved
one thing, at least.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And that?” questioned Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That” repeated Jack, “is that Britannia, as
ever, rules the wave!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXV' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br />AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Aboard H. M. S. battle cruiser <i>Alto</i> subdued excitement
prevailed. It was six o’clock the morning
after the first British naval victory off Helgoland,
and still, for some unaccountable reason, the commander
of the <i>Alto</i> had received no information of
the battle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alice Beulow, pale from loss of sleep and tired
to the point of exhaustion, paced to and fro in her
little cabin. Several times she fell upon her knees
beside her bed and prayed, for, by the mandate of
the court-martial, she had less than two hours to
live.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the forward lookout on the <i>Alto</i> made out
the first sign of a swiftly approaching vessel. Rapidly
it came on. Under instructions from Captain
Johnson, the wireless operator was attempting to
“pick up” the oncoming craft, but, after several
futile attempts, finally gave it up. The stranger
vouchsafed no reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>The cruiser’s bell tolled the half hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Half past seven!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The words escaped the kneeling girl. She arose
and, going to a little mirror, straightened her hair.
She was beyond tears, and was preparing to meet
her death bravely. She had given up all hope of
rescue.</p>

<p class='c004'>Came a knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come!” she called, and Lieutenant Berkeley
entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you ready, Miss Beulow,” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” replied the girl calmly, and followed him
on deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the farthest point aft on the cruiser the lieutenant
led the way, Alice following with a firm step.
As she reached the selected spot and stopped, there
came a cry from the lookout:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Boat coming toward the <i>Alto</i>, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>All eyes were turned in the direction indicated.
Still some distance away, it was discovered that the
vessel seen approaching earlier in the morning had
come to anchor, and that a small boat had been
lowered, and was rapidly approaching the <i>Alto</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The firing squad had been selected the night
before, and now stood ready. At this moment the
first officer came up and took the rifles from the
hands of the six men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Three rifles will be loaded with blank cartridges,”
he informed the men, “so that it will be
impossible to say which man’s bullet kills the prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sailors all breathed easier. It was something
for each man to know that there was a possibility
that he would not be the one to snuff out the life of
the young girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant Taylor!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Captain Johnson who spoke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor, who stood nearby, approached
the commander of the <i>Alto</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will relieve Lieutenant Berkeley and take
command of the firing squad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant’s face turned a trifle pale, but he
saluted the commander, then turned on his heel and
took Lieutenant Berkeley’s place at the head of the
death squad.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will give the command to fire at eight
o’clock precisely,” Captain Johnson instructed him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir,” was the lieutenant’s reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Alice Beulow turned upon the traitor a scornful
smile, but she uttered no sound. She recognized
the folly of a plea for life at this late hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>With her back to the ship’s rail she waved aside
the man who approached with a bandage for her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am innocent,” she said quietly, “and am not
afraid to die!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man stepped back, abashed. Lieutenant Taylor
now was trembling perceptibly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish that I could undo this,” he muttered to
himself, “but it is her life or mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He pulled himself together, and faced the firing
squad.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this moment there came a shout from the sea.
Captain Johnson looked over the side of the <i>Alto</i>.
The small launch was now almost alongside, and
the commander could see the form of a young man
in the uniform of a midshipman directing the approach
of the craft.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter shouted something unintelligible as
the launch scraped alongside the cruiser.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later Lieutenant Taylor, whose
thoughts had been so wrapped up in the black deed
he was about to commit that he had not noticed
the approach of the launch, gave the command:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ready!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Unflinchingly Alice Beulow, with a slight smile
on her lips, faced the firing squad.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hands of each man trembled, and the face
of each was pale.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, suddenly, before Lieutenant Taylor could
give the next command, Frank Chadwick bounded
over the side of the <i>Alto</i>, nor did he hesitate for a
moment. In spite of all attempts to stop him, he
rushed toward the spot where Alice Beulow was
facing death.</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson barred the lad’s progress. But
Frank was not to be stopped. He dashed ahead
with such speed that the captain was thrust violently
aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the commander clapped his hand to
where a moment before his sword had hung by his
side. But, even as he did so, the blade leaped, as
though alive, from his scabbard, and an instant
later Frank brandished it aloft!</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the lad sprang upon Lieutenant Taylor,
who even at that second had raised his hand to
give his second command to the firing squad:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take aim!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But before he could give the command to fire,
Frank was upon him. Startled, the lieutenant
leaped back, forgetting the girl, the firing squad,
everything but that his nemesis had run him to
earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>He succeeded in drawing his sword just in time
to parry a slashing blow which Frank aimed at him
with the commander’s sword; but a second later
the lad had closed with him, and the lieutenant’s
sword was practically useless.</p>

<p class='c004'>The appearance of the apparition from over the
side of the <i>Alto</i>, and its sudden dash into the center
of the firing squad, had taken the cruiser’s officers
by surprise. But now Captain Johnson pulled himself
together, and his voice and Lieutenant Taylor’s
rang out at the same time with an order to
the firing squad:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shoot him!”</p>

<p class='c004'>But one man was in a position to obey the command
without fear of accidentally shooting the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quickly he brought his rifle to bear, and his finger
tightened upon the trigger. There was a sharp
crack. But Frank did not fall. The cartridge in
the rifle had been a blank.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the struggling combatants scuffled and twisted
so rapidly that it was impossible for any of the
sailors to shoot Frank without imminent risk of
hitting Lieutenant Taylor, while the latter, realizing
for the first time just how near death he was,
put forth his utmost strength to free himself, but
in vain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the lad released his hold and threw
both his arms around the lieutenant, the sword still
grasped in his right hand. Then his left hand
gripped the naked blade, and, with a quick snap,
broke it off a foot from the hilt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more releasing the lieutenant from his close
embrace, he took a backward step, following instantly
by a quick lunge forward again, which sent
his shortened sword straight and true into the traitor
lieutenant’s breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lieutenant Taylor slid gently to the deck, gave
a single convulsive sob and lay still.</p>

<p class='c004'>Without one look at the girl whose life he had
saved at the imminent risk of his own, Frank
stepped up to Captain Johnson, saluted, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sir! there lies the traitor. I arrived just in time
to prevent you from committing a terrible crime.
Miss Beulow is innocent.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who are you, sir?” demanded Captain Johnson,
waving back the sailors who had again leveled
their rifles at the lad. “Why should I not have you
shot at once?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am Midshipman Chadwick, sir, of His Majesty’s
scout cruiser <i>Sylph</i>. I am here at Lord Hastings’
command to save an innocent girl! This was
the only way I could do it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And where is Lord Hastings?” asked the commander.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aboard the <i>Sylph</i> yonder, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then why did he not come, instead of sending
you? Or why did he not order the execution stayed
by wireless?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our wireless is out of commission; and Lord
Hastings is ill with a fever, sir!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Captain Johnson was silent for some moments.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must of necessity place you and Miss Beulow
under arrest,” he said at length, “but the execution
is stayed until I have inquired further into the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, sir,” replied Frank. “It is all I
have fought for!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br />BY ORDER OF THE KING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Alice Beulow had been the first to see Frank as
he jumped over the rail of the <i>Alto</i>. As he rushed
toward her captors she had sent up a fervent prayer
of thanks. Various emotions were depicted in her
face as the lad struggled with the traitor who had
almost succeeded in lying her life away.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the sailor had brought his rifle to bear
on the lad, and the girl saw him pull the trigger,
her strong will had finally given way, and she fell
fainting to the deck. She was revived at length and
carried to her cabin, still under arrest.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank also had been arrested by command of
Captain Johnson, and confined. Half an hour later,
however, the commander ordered him brought to
his cabin, and had the lad relate the full story of
Lieutenant Taylor’s treachery and the details of the
first British naval victory off Helgoland.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am inclined to believe your story,” said the
captain, when Frank had concluded. “I am now
going aboard the <i>Sylph</i> to pay my respects to Lord
Hastings, and you and Miss Beulow shall accompany me.
You will consider yourself under arrest,
however, until I have seen Lord Hastings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later the three were ushered into
Lord Hastings’ cabin aboard the <i>Sylph</i>, where the
little scout cruiser’s commander lay propped up in
bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few words sufficed to clear up the situation
so far as Captain Johnson was concerned, and then
the latter took Frank by the hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are a gallant lad,” he said, “and I am
proud to know you. My prophecy is that you will
not long remain a midshipman.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank thanked the commander of the <i>Alto</i>, and,
at a nod from Lord Hastings, which indicated that
the latter desired to be alone with Captain Johnson,
Frank and Alice Beulow made their way to the
deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside the captain’s cabin they ran into Jack,
who had been eagerly waiting to learn what all the
trouble was about. Alice soon explained the situation
to him, and then Jack did a dance of enthusiasm
about the deck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So you killed the traitor, eh?” he said at last,
coming to a stop in his contortions. “Good for
you! I should like to have done it myself. You
are a brave chum, old man, and I am glad to have
you for one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No more glad than I am to have you for a
chum,” replied Frank. “I have done nothing you
wouldn’t have done had you been in my place. It
was simply luck, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was a brave action,” put in Alice Beulow,
“and for the second time I owe you my life. The
debt, I fear, can never be repaid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was nothing any other fellow would not have
done,” protested Frank modestly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But tell me how you happened to arrive so opportunely,”
demanded Alice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “after the battle, our first
thought was of you. We had heard, just before
our wireless apparatus was put out of commission,
of your arrest, but, until after the battle, we could
do nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Since noon yesterday we have been scouring the
sea for the <i>Alto</i>, and we were beginning to fear
that we should not locate you in time. The loss
of our wireless came near proving fatal. It was
early this morning when we finally made out what
we felt sure was the <i>Alto</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He doesn’t tell you, Miss Beulow,” Jack broke
in, “how he stood watch all that time without a
wink of sleep; and that but for the keenness of his
eye we should probably have missed you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Frank, “I could do nothing less.
But that’s all there is to the story. Now, Miss
Beulow, will you tell us your experiences aboard
the <i>Alto</i>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girl complied, and the boys listened with the
greatest of interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The cowardly traitor!” exclaimed Jack, when
she concluded. “I should like to have got my
hands on him!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He will bother no one else,” said Frank simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later Captain Johnson emerged from
Lord Hastings’ cabin. Before leaving the <i>Sylph</i>
he again approached Frank and shook hands with
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I can ever be of service to you,” he said, on
taking his departure, “command me. I shall never
forget that your bravery alone saved me from putting
an innocent girl to death!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank thanked the gallant commander, and the
latter disappeared over the side with a backward
wave of his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon the <i>Sylph</i> was under way again, speeding
swiftly toward the far distant western horizon. For
a long time, Alice Beulow, Frank and Jack leaned
over the rail of the little cruiser, gazing at the
swiftly passing greenish water. Then the three
were summoned to Lord Hastings’ cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>The commander of the <i>Sylph</i>, still propped up
in bed, greeted Frank with a smile, and, beckoning
the lad to him, gave his hand a hearty clasp, in
spite of his apparent feebleness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Captain Johnson has told me of your gallant
action aboard the <i>Alto</i>,” he said; “and I add my
praise to his. It was a brave deed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank passed the compliment off modestly, and
Lord Hastings continued:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall see that your conduct does not go unrewarded.
But what I summoned you all here to say
is that we are returning to London.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To London!” exclaimed Jack, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes. There the <i>Sylph</i> will undergo the necessary
repairs, which probably will take a week. At
the end of that time I hope to have recovered to
such an extent that we shall be able to put to sea
immediately. I feel much stronger the last few
hours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And then back to Helgoland,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” replied Lord Hastings, “I think not. I
believe that our next cruise will be in the Mediterranean.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Mediterranean!” exclaimed Jack. “Why
not the North Sea? Don’t you think there will be
more fighting there, sir?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not immediately,” was the reply. “After the
blow we have just inflicted upon the German fleet
I believe it will be some time before the enemy will
venture forth again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then there is no likelihood of Admiral Jellicoe’s
forcing a battle by going in after the Germans?”
queried Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I fear that would be suicide. The guns of a
fortress, you know, are of much heavier caliber
than it is possible to mount upon a war vessel. Besides,
the harbor is mined, and there would, I am
afraid, be but slight hope of success for British
arms in such a venture.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And yet,” said Frank, with a smile, “there was
a certain American admiral in the Civil War who
said something about paying no heed to the torpedoes
when he steamed into Mobile Bay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” admitted Lord Hastings, “and there was
another American admiral who also disregarded
the mines at Manila. But don’t you fret,” he continued,
“you will find that Admiral Jellicoe is of
the same caliber, should he deem such a venturesome
exploit essential.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure of it,” agreed Jack. “From what
little I saw of him the other night, I am willing to
bet that he is not the man to shirk a necessary task
because of danger.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I agree with you,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I didn’t call you here to discuss warfare,” said
Lord Hastings, after some further conversation
along this line, “but rather to find out what we shall
do with Miss Beulow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am perfectly willing to abide by whatever decision
you may reach,” said the girl, with a smile.
“I am sure you will not find me hard to please.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What would you suggest, sir?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Lord Hastings, “as you boys know,
I am a married man. I am sure that my wife would
be glad to have Miss Beulow make her home with
her until such time as she can get into Germany
with safety.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I can impose no further upon your generosity,”
protested the girl. “You have been too
good to me now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tut, tut,” chided Lord Hastings, “it will be no
imposition. Besides I am sure it is only a question
of a few weeks until some arrangement will be
made whereby German subjects in England and
British subjects in Germany will be furnished
means of returning to their native lands. Now,
what do you say to my plan, Miss Beulow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure she will accept,” said Frank eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>For several moments the girl did not speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she said at length; “I shall accept; and
I thank you, Lord Hastings, for your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This matter having been settled, Lord Hastings
announced that he thought a good nap would do
him good, and the young folks went on deck to
enjoy the sunshine. Later in the day Lord Hastings
was also able to be on deck, and, while the
<i>Sylph</i> slipped rapidly along through the water, entertained
the others with accounts of his travels.</p>

<p class='c004'>Toward sunset Frank made out what appeared
to be land.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What land is it?” he inquired of Lord Hastings.</p>

<p class='c004'>The <i>Sylph’s</i> commander took his glasses and
carefully observed the land through the hazy atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It must be the coast of Denmark,” he replied,
after a moment’s hesitation, “although I did not
realize that we were that far north. We must have
sailed considerably off our course.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Night came on and still the <i>Sylph</i> continued her
homeward journey without interruption, although
a watch for evidence of any German vessel was
being carefully kept.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was while at supper that the peaceful calm on
board was rudely broken.</p>

<p class='c004'>From on deck came the sound of scuffling feet,
followed by shouts and at length a shot. Then
came the sound of running feet, a moment of silence,
followed again by a volley of pistol shots.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings arose slowly to his feet and made
his way on deck, closely followed by Frank and
Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the trouble?” demanded Lord Hastings,
approaching a group of sailors, who stood at the
rail, firing into the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the men stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s that traitor. Hardy, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hardy!” exclaimed Lord Hastings. “What
about him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has escaped, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I ordered him put in irons and carefully
guarded.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And he was, sir. I can vouch for that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then how did he escape?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, sir; but he freed himself of his
shackles in some manner. There he goes now, sir,
in the motor. You can just make him out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How is it that you did not recapture him before
he could get away?” demanded his lordship.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, he came upon us all of a sudden like, sir.
He knocked two men down before we knew what
had happened. Then he put the boat over the side
and jumped in. I took a shot at him, as he jumped,
but missed. He must have started the engine the
moment he struck the boat, for he was moving in
a jiffy. We all ran to the rail, and fired several
shots at him, but it doesn’t look like we hit him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Jack broke into the conversation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why can’t I take the other boat and go after
him?” he demanded. “I am sure I can overhaul
him before he has gone very far. And, when I
do&mdash;well, I’ll bring him back, all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings hesitated for one moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” he finally said. “Take five men with
you, and hustle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am going, too,” Frank broke in.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much,” said Jack. “You have had all the
glory. It’s time for me to get into this game.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In almost less time than it takes to tell it, the
second launch had been lowered and, with Jack at
the steering wheel, was off in the darkness after the
traitor. The powerful searchlight on the little boat
lighted up the sea for a long distance ahead, and at
least a mile away Jack could make out the craft in
which Hardy was heading for the Danish coast.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Jack to himself, “it’s up to me to
catch him, and I won’t come back till I do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings had told him that the <i>Sylph</i> would
remain where she was until he returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under Jack’s orders the launch was leaping
ahead at full speed, and after an hour it became
apparent that the pursuers were gaining slightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At this rate,” said Jack to himself, “we won’t
overhaul him before daylight. But we shall keep
after him as fast as we can.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And keep after him they did; but their efforts
to catch the traitor were doomed to disappointment,
the two launches were so nearly matched.</p>

<p class='c004'>The night now grew blacker, as it always does
just before dawn, and now the headlight on the
pursuing launch, besides showing Jack the escaping
fugitive, also showed him the outline of the coast
less than half a mile ahead of the fugitive.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the first sight of the coast Jack uttered an
exclamation of dismay, although he did not slacken
the speed of the launch, which continued to creep
closer and closer to the fugitive.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the first, faint streak of dawn appeared in
the sky, Hardy ran his boat close to shore and,
standing erect, jumped headlong into the water. A
moment later and he reappeared and struck out for
land.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now that his quarry was safe ashore, Jack approached
more cautiously, for he was not minded
to run his little craft upon a rock. But when the
pursuers were finally able to land Hardy had disappeared
in the distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack turned to his men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will stay here until I return,” he informed
them. “I may be gone a long time&mdash;there is no
telling. Wait for me an hour after nightfall, and
if I have not then returned you will go back to the
<i>Sylph</i>. Do not come ashore, for this is neutral
ground,” and the lad hurried in the direction in
which the fugitive had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I can catch him before we are discovered,”
he told himself, “he’ll come back all right. If not,
well, I don’t know. If discovered I suppose we
shall both be disarmed and interned,” for Jack was
not unfamiliar with neutrality laws, and he realized
that if discovered he would probably not be allowed
to leave the country until the war had ended.</p>

<p class='c004'>But if Jack had expected to overhaul the fugitive
and take him back to the <i>Sylph</i> without trouble,
he was doomed to disappointment. As he hurried
on through the little woods there was the
sudden sound of a shot, and a bullet whistled over his
head.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad sprang behind a tree and quickly drew
his revolver.</p>

<p class='c004'>A moment later there was a second shot, and
Jack saw a flash from behind a tree scarcely a
hundred feet away. He aimed quickly at an arm
which extended from behind the tree and fired.
A howl of pain rewarded him; but Jack was too
wary to step from behind his shelter, although he
looked cautiously in the direction of his enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he surmised, it was the traitor Hardy who
had shot at him. The fugitive now lay sprawled
on the ground, and even from where Jack stood
he could hear the man’s moans. The bullet had
struck him in the elbow&mdash;on the “crazy bone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack stepped quickly from behind his tree and
rapidly crossed the distance that separated him from
his wounded enemy. As he came close, Hardy
suddenly sprang to his feet and, unable to bring
his revolver to bear quickly enough, struck a savage
blow at the lad.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack dodged the blow and promptly sent his fist
between the other’s eyes, knocking him to the
ground in a sprawling heap.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess that will teach you I am not to be fooled
with,” he said angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lad stooped over and lifted his unconscious
enemy to his own shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now to get back to the launch before I am discovered,”
he said, and, turning, he started off rapidly
in the direction from which he had come.</p>

<p class='c004'>But he was not to carry his task to a successful
termination so easily; for hardly had he gone fifty
feet, when he was brought to an abrupt pause by
the sound of a harsh command:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Halt!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning, the lad dropped his burden to the
ground and, after a moment’s hesitation, threw his
hands above his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is what I call tough,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c004'>For, not fifty yards behind him, and approaching
at a run, came an officer with leveled revolver, and
behind him a squad of soldiers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br />NEUTRAL HOSPITALITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The officer came up to the lad quickly, and held
out his hand for the boy’s revolver, which Jack
gave him without a word.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded in
broken English.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack smiled slightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, as you have got me, I don’t mind telling,”
he replied. “I am a midshipman on the British
scout cruiser <i>Sylph</i>. This man is a traitor, who
would have delivered the British fleet into the hands
of the Germans. Fortunately, his treachery was
discovered in time. Last night, however, he succeeded
in making his escape, and I was sent after
him. I had just persuaded him that he had better
return when you arrived. That’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Danish officer permitted the semblance of
a smile to cross his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your methods of persuasion are to be commended,”
he said dryly, “but, while they may be
permissible in times of war, there is no war in
Denmark. Denmark is absolutely neutral. I suppose
you are aware of that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack signified that he was.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then,” said the officer, “you must realize that
you have carried this thing too far.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” answered Jack, “I figured that if you
didn’t catch me it would be all right. But I was
afraid you or someone just like you might show
up. But, if I could have got away with this man,
I would have been all right, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the Danish officer smiled slightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are frank, at any rate,” he said. “I am
sorry, but it is my duty to take you to Esbjerg and
turn you over to my superiors. My sympathies in
the case have nothing to do with the matter. I
may say, however, that I am sorry you have fallen
into my hands. Had I known what was going on I
would have become temporarily deaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks,” said Jack dryly. “But are you sure
it is too late to become deaf now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly sure,” said the officer, smiling. “You
see, my men might not be afflicted at the same time.
I am sorry, but I must ask you to come with me
peaceably, or I shall be compelled to use force.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’ll come peaceably enough,” said Jack.
“But what will be done with me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll not be harmed, be sure of that; but the
chances are that you will not be allowed to leave
the country until after the war. And it seems to
me that you should be glad of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I’m not,” said Jack warmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said the officer, “I don’t suppose you are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to the wounded Hardy and stirred his
prostrate form with his foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ugh!” he ejaculated. “I have no use for a
traitor, be he English or German.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to his men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pick him up and bring him along,” he commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two of the soldiers did as ordered, and the party
started off, the Danish officer and Jack in the lead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the name of this place you are taking
me to?” demanded Jack, as they walked along.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Esbjerg,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, a town or a conundrum?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer drew himself up stiffly. Jack was
contrite in a second.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I beg your pardon,” he hastened to say. “I
didn’t mean to offend you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer became his good-natured self again
in a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say no more about it,” he said. “I thought
you were making fun of me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no,” said Jack, “I wouldn’t try to do that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They continued their way, Jack and the Danish
officer on the best of terms. At length a few
scattering houses came into view, and Jack saw that
they were approaching a little town.</p>

<p class='c004'>Straight through the streets of the town they
went, what few pedestrians that were abroad at this
early hour eying them askance. But no word
was spoken.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally Jack’s captor stopped at the entrance of
a building somewhat larger than the rest, and turned
to his men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take him,” indicating the wounded Hardy, “to
the hospital, and see that his wounds are attended
to and that he is well guarded.” To Jack he added:
“Come with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Together they ascended the steps and passed
through the door of the building. Into a large and
handsomely appointed room the officer led his captive.
At a large desk at one end of the apartment
sat a large, ruddy-faced man in uniform, his straps,
to Jack’s educated eye, proclaiming his rank as that
of general.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general arose to his feet as the officer and
Jack approached him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what have we here?” he demanded, in a
loud, booming voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I captured this young English officer in the act
of carrying an enemy from Danish soil,” replied
the officer, saluting. “It was a violation of our
neutrality, so I placed him under arrest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” said the general; “and the other man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is in the hospital, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hospital? Do you mean to say that they were
fighting on Danish soil?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As to that I couldn’t say, sir,” replied the officer.
“I heard shots, but I did not see them fired.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general turned abruptly to Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your name?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Midshipman Jack Templeton, sir, of His Majesty’s
navy,” replied the lad, with a bow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Explain your presence in Denmark,” came the
next command.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack explained, and, after he had concluded his
recital, the Danish general was silent for some moments.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Uh-m-m-m,” he said finally, and his voice was
not so harsh. “How old are you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seventeen, sir,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are indeed young to have seen so much
service,” mused the general. “But this is a serious
case. I am afraid I shall have to order you interned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is there no way out of that, sir?” asked Jack,
now greatly alarmed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am afraid not; but, have no fear, you shall be
well treated while you are our guest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guest,” repeated Jack bitterly, “say rather your
prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not if you will give me your parole not to attempt
to escape,” said the general kindly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t do that, sir,” replied Jack, taken somewhat
aback by the old general’s kindness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I fear that I must order you confined.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general turned to the officer who had captured
Jack; but before he could open his mouth to
speak, the abrupt entrance of another figure into
the room caused him to turn with his order left
unspoken.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the newcomer advanced into the room, both
Danish officers saluted, and then bowed low. Instinctively
Jack felt that he was in the presence of
royalty, and he also bent his knee in homage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nor was he wrong, for the good-natured, kindly-faced
smiling man, who now approached them,
was none other than Christian X, King of Denmark.
In his eye there was a twinkle, and there was a
humorous quirk to his mouth, only partly hidden
by his mustache.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nodding to the two officers, the king walked
directly up to Jack, who, being the subject of a
king himself, fell upon his knee. The king extended
a hand and lifted the boy to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have overheard your conversation, sirs,” he
said quietly, and, turning once more to Jack, “and
I am indeed proud to have the pleasure of meeting
so valiant an English youth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thank your majesty,” said Jack in great confusion,
and could say no more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is indeed unfortunate that you should have
fallen into our hands,” continued the king, “for it
must be as you have been told. Denmark is strictly
neutral, and neutral she shall remain while I am
king. You, I regret to say, must stay with us. But
you shall be well treated. I myself shall see to
that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack bowed again as the king finished.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No doubt you are hungry,” the king continued,
“for you could not have eaten during your
long chase. My own breakfast is now ready, and
I hope I may have the pleasure of your company?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The king’s last words were an interrogation and,
overcome by this hospitality, Jack could do naught
but nod his head in assent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, then,” said the king, and he turned
toward the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack followed him from the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXVIII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <br />A DASH FOR FREEDOM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Despite the fact that he was sadly lacking in a
knowledge of court etiquette, Jack acquitted himself
creditably in breakfasting with royalty. He
recounted his adventures preceding the time he
joined the British navy and gave the king an account
of his early life. He spoke of Frank several
times, and finally the king was moved to ask:</p>

<p class='c004'>“And your friend&mdash;this American youth&mdash;is he
as great a fighter as you are?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Frank is a fighter,” was Jack’s reply. “I
don’t know as I come in that class,” modestly, “but
Frank is a mighty good friend to have around in
time of need.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No better than you, I’ll warrant,” the king made
answer, as he arose from the table. “But come, I
have many affairs to attend to, which is the reason
I came here from Copenhagen yesterday, so I shall
have to turn you over to someone for safekeeping.
It would not do to have you get away; and besides,
I have promised myself more of your company.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack followed the king back into the room where
the general still sat at his desk, and was turned
over to the latter by the king with this parting injunction:</p>

<p class='c004'>“See that he has everything he wants, and see
also that he is well guarded until I have decided
what final disposition to make of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the other prisoner?” questioned the general.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I haven’t much sympathy for the other,”
said the king, “but he, too, must be treated well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The general bowed his head in assent, and the
king left the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hardly know what to do with you,” mused
the general, tapping on his desk with a lead pencil.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was silent for some moments, meditating.
Finally he struck a bell and a moment later an
orderly entered the room and came to a salute.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Summon Lieutenant Erickson,” commanded the
general.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few minutes later a young, pleasant-looking
Danish officer entered the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>The general introduced the two young men to
each other, and then said to the lieutenant:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lieutenant, I turn Mr. Templeton over to you.
You will treat him as a guest rather than as a prisoner.
But you will be responsible for him. See
that he does not escape.” To Jack he added: “You
see, we are trying to make it as pleasant as
possible for you. I hope that you will not make it necessary
for us to use more forcible means to induce
you to accept our hospitality.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack bowed, but made no reply. He did not intend
to commit himself one way or the other, but
he had made up his mind to make a dash for liberty
if the slightest chance offered. He had another
thought in his head also: He did not intend to
go back to the <i>Sylph</i> without the object of his chase&mdash;the
traitor Hardy.</p>

<p class='c004'>With Lieutenant Erickson, Jack wandered about
the streets of the city all morning viewing the
sights of interest. It was after 12 o’clock when
they stopped into a little restaurant to get something
to eat. Several other officers were in the café
when the two entered, and Lieutenant Erickson
introduced the lad to all of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally, when all the Danish officers were in the
midst of a discussion of the great European war,
the chance for which Jack had been impatiently
waiting came. And the boy was not slow to take
advantage of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The table at which the party was seated was near
the door. The heads of all the officers were now
close together, and so engrossed were they in their
discussion that they paid no heed to Jack, as he
quietly rose from the table and slipped toward the
door.</p>

<p class='c004'>But, just as Jack put his foot over the threshold,
Lieutenant Erickson noticed his absence and sprang
to his feet with a shout. The others followed his
example and made a concerted rush for the door,
through which Jack was at that moment disappearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dashing out the door the lad ran madly down
the street, and turned the first corner just before
the officers emerged from the restaurant. For a
moment they stood in the doorway puzzled, not
knowing in which way the fugitive had fled.</p>

<p class='c004'>But for a moment only. They hailed a passing
pedestrian, and from him learned which way the
lad had gone. All immediately dashed away in
pursuit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Jack was considerable of a sprinter, so when
the officers rounded the corner the lad was nowhere
in sight. For perhaps fifteen minutes Jack
ran as fast as his legs could carry him, turning
corner after corner, until at last he was forced to
slow down to regain his breath. However, he now
felt that he had given his pursuers the slip, so he
continued to walk along more slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the lad’s utter ignorance of the city landed
him in more trouble, for, in winding about
through the various streets, as he had, he suddenly
came right back to the starting point. Here, owing
to the confusion occasioned by his dash for liberty,
a crowd had gathered, the restaurant proprietor
among them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The latter recognized Jack the minute he came
into sight, and yelled in a loud voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“There he is! There he is!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack immediately took to his heels again, with
the crowd in full chase. And, as he rounded the
next comer, he came upon the party of officers,
who, unable to find him, were returning to the
starting point to take up the search anew.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack now was caught between two fires, so to
speak. For a moment he halted, as his pursuers
bore down on him from two directions with shouts
and yells. But his inaction lasted only a moment.
His roving eyes fell upon a little alleyway across
the street, and into this he dashed at full speed, his
pursuers hot on his trail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Out of the alleyway and down the next street
the lad ran, those behind being left farther in the
rear at almost every stride. Then, espying another
narrow alleyway, and thinking to give his pursuers
the slip entirely, the lad dashed into it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Had he made his way into this narrow alleyway
unseen, it is likely he would have eluded his pursuers
for good and all; but he didn’t. One man
rounded the corner just in time to see the lad turn,
and he made after him with a shout.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack still had quite a lead, however, and was not
disheartened; but, as he rounded a little curve in
his retreat, his heart almost stopped beating, and
he came to a sudden pause. For the passageway
was a blind one. The lad had run up against a
solid wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>And, at the same minute the lad stopped in his
flight, the first pursuer came into view again. As
Jack was just about to turn and give himself up&mdash;for
he knew he could not hope to fight off his pursuers&mdash;a
window suddenly opened above his head,
and a woman’s head was poked out.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack glanced up. With outstretched hands he
could easily grasp the window sill. He considered
a fraction of a second, then reached up, grasped
the sill, and pulled himself up into the open window.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman, startled at the sudden apparition,
drew back, and attempted to close the window; but
Jack threw one leg over the sill. The window
came down on it with great force; but it did not
close.</p>

<p class='c004'>The woman grabbed the lad by the foot and
attempted to force him out, but he was not to be
thrust into the hands of his pursuers thus easily,
and after several attempts the woman desisted and
ran screaming through the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately Jack pushed up the window and
dropped lightly into the room. The window he
closed and locked almost with a single move in
the very faces of his trailers. Then he turned and
dashed across the room, making for the front door.</p>

<p class='c004'>But by the time he reached it he found this means
of exit barred, for some of the pursuers, the moment
they had seen him spring into the window,
had rushed around to the front entrance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Realizing that there was no hope of escape in
that direction, the lad turned and dashed up the
stairs to the second floor. There, in a back room,
as his gaze roved about, he beheld a trap door in
the ceiling. Pulling a chair to the middle of the
room, he mounted it, laid his hands against the
trap door and pushed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The door fell off on the outside, and a moment
later Jack was on the roof. The trap door he put
back in its place, and sat on it a moment to regain
his breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he sat there looking around for some means
of escape there came a fierce thumping on the door
upon which he sat. Jack smiled to himself
slightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They can only come up one at a time,” he muttered.
“I guess I can take care of them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He arose. There came another resounding
smash, and the trap door flew off, splintered by a
fierce blow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack dropped to his knees beside the opening.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <br />JACK TRIES A RUSE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A head was poked cautiously through the opening,
and a second later a uniformed arm appeared.
Jack leaned forward, put his hand on the man’s
head, and gave a violent push. The head disappeared
on the inside; there was the sound of a
heavy fall below, followed by a sound of great confusion
and muttered imprecations.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonder what they’ll try next?” muttered Jack
to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had not long to wait. A second time a head
was poked cautiously through the opening, and a
second time Jack’s hand shot forth and there was
the sound of a heavy fall below. A third time this
was tried, but, when the third man had been hurled
back, no fourth head appeared in the opening.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” mused Jack, “I guess they have had
enough of that. Suppose they have something else
up their sleeves now. I shall have to be watchful.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At that moment the lad heard a footstep behind
him, and turned quickly, just in time to grapple
with a man who sprang upon him. While Jack
had been busy watching the trap door, a ladder had
been placed against the side of the house, and the
pursuers were climbing up.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a quick wrench Jack hurled the man from
him, dashed toward the ladder and arrived just in
time to deal the man who was just about to set foot
upon the roof a heavy blow. A quick glance
showed him several more forms swarming up the
ladder.</p>

<p class='c004'>With a quick kick he swept the ladder aside,
hurling all upon it to the ground with stunning
force; then turned again just in time to meet the
assault of the one man already on the roof.</p>

<p class='c004'>This assailant struck out vigorously, but, in spite
of Jack’s youth, the man was no match for him
when it came to close quarters. Jack picked the
man up in his arms bodily and ran to the trap door
just as another head appeared in the opening.</p>

<p class='c004'>Standing over the opening Jack lifted up his
human burden and let him drop. He struck
squarely upon the head of the other, and both went
to the floor below with a loud thud. Jack glanced
quickly around, to see if there were any other ladders
being placed against the side of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>He could see none, so he mounted guard over
the trap door. But not another form appeared
through this opening either. Jack stood there for
several moments, but no further attempts were
made to reach him. Making sure that there was no
one below, the lad walked quickly around the roof.</p>

<p class='c004'>One man stood guard on each side of the house
and a big crowd was packed in front.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something up,” Jack muttered to himself.
“They evidently are convinced they cannot reach
me this way and are going to try something else.
I guess it’s up to me to get out of here very suddenly.
But how?”</p>

<p class='c004'>That was the question, and the boy gave it some
reflection. Then, as he made another tour of the
roof, a plan came to him. It was a desperate
chance, but he could think of no other way of
escape.</p>

<p class='c004'>Making sure that the crowd was all in front,
the boy ran quickly to the back of the house. There
was a guard directly below him, but, as luck would
have it, the man at that very moment was engaged
in the task of lighting a pipe.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack acted without a pause. Swiftly and silently
he lowered himself from the roof, hanging by his
hands directly over the guard’s head. Then, giving
himself a little swing outward, he dropped.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a long drop, but the lad had gauged the
distance correctly, and the force of the fall was
broken by the man below, upon whose shoulders
the lad dropped like a human thunderbolt.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man went to the ground without so much
as a groan, Jack on top of him. Although
somewhat shaken up by his fall, Jack did not lose his
presence of mind for a single moment, and his
hand clutched the guard’s throat, throttling any
outcry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Jack’s further resourcefulness became apparent.
Glancing quickly about to make sure that
no one was in sight&mdash;the walls of the house obstructing
the view of those on the sides and in
front&mdash;the lad lifted the guard bodily in his arms
and carried him to a little shed in the rear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quickly he stripped the officer&mdash;for such his victim
proved to be&mdash;of his uniform, and hastily
donned it himself. Hurriedly he bound and gagged
his captive, and then walked from the shed and
took the guard’s place in the rear of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>And he arrived there not a moment too soon, for
at that instant a band of soldiers appeared, bearing
many ladders. These they leaned against the side
of the house in different places, and one man
mounted each, cautiously, for fear of being hurled
back by the fugitive they believed to be on the
roof.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack walked round to the front of the house,
and, keeping his head lowered, mingled with the
crowd. At that moment there came a shout from
the roof:</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s not here!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then there came another cry:</p>

<p class='c004'>“The trap door! He must have gone back
through the trap door!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” came another voice, “he has not come
down this way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“About time for me to make myself scarce,”
Jack told himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sauntered slowly away and was soon out of
sight of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was now well along in the afternoon. Jack
looked at his watch. It was almost 4 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I can find the hospital,” he told himself, “I
may manage to work this thing out yet. I’ve got
to take a chance, and that’s all there is about it.
The worst of it is that I cannot afford to ask for
directions. A Danish officer surely should know
where the hospital is located. Well, here goes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He continued slowly down the street, keeping a
sharp lookout for anything that looked like it
might be a hospital. He walked with lowered head,
for, while his uniform gave him a certain amount
of safety, he wished to run no unnecessary risk of
detection.</p>

<p class='c004'>For almost an hour he strolled about the town,
and at last his efforts were rewarded. He stopped
before a large and imposing building.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This looks like a hospital to me,” he said. “It
is hardly likely they have more than one in a town
of this size, and Hardy probably was taken here.
Guess I better look around a bit, however, before
I go in, though. I might spot another one some
place. It’s too bad I can’t read Danish. It might
be easier if I could.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack walked on, and a few blocks farther down,
the street passed a body of Danish cavalry moving
at a rapid trot in the direction from which he
had come. Jack smiled grimly to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Going to help search for the fugitive, I guess.
Well, I hope they don’t find him, or the guard,
either, for it might make it a little awkward for
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gazed after the cavalry as it disappeared
around a corner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A likely looking crowd,” he said in some admiration.
“I’ll bet they could give a good account
of themselves when it came to a fight. Hope I
don’t have to line up against any of them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned and retraced his steps toward the
building in which he felt sure he would find Hardy.
He mounted the long flight of stone steps with a
firm tread and entered the door. A quick glance
showed him that he had not been mistaken. The
place was a hospital and no mistake.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now to find out where my friend Hardy is,”
the lad muttered.</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked slowly about the halls, looking for
the office. His search was at length rewarded.
Glancing in an open door, he saw several clerks at
work, and at one end of the room, separated from
the others by a railing, an important-looking man,
unmistakably a physician.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The superintendent, I suppose, or whatever he
is called in this country,” muttered Jack. “I guess
I had better talk in German. English wouldn’t do
at all. But, suppose they won’t let me have Hardy
without a written order? Oh, well, I’ll have to take
a chance on that. Here we go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack drew a deep breath, straightened himself
up, and with a firm step entered the room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXX' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <br />THE RUSE SUCCESSFUL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Jack approached the man he took to be the superintendent.
The latter looked up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, sir?” he demanded in German.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m in luck,” said Jack to himself, but aloud he
made reply:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am ordered to take the English prisoner, who
was brought here this morning, before the king.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your order,” said the superintendent, extending
a hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is a hurry case,” said Jack quietly, “and
His Majesty did not take time to write an order.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, you won’t get him without it,” said the
superintendent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I must have him at once,” said Jack firmly.
“Either you shall deliver him to me, or I shall have
to use force. My orders are to bring him before
the king immediately. Shall I call my men?” and
the lad took a step toward the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>The physician looked at the lad keenly, and Jack
returned his gaze unflinchingly. Finally the physician
arose.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come, then,” he said; “but I would have you
inform His Majesty that in the future I must insist
upon a written order.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack bowed coldly, and followed the physician
from the room. Up two flights of stairs they went,
and from there into a private room, fitted up luxuriously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You see,” the superintendent explained, “the
prisoner has the best that we can offer. I hope
that you will see fit to inform His Majesty that his
orders are being obeyed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall be glad to do so,” replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>He followed the physician to the bedside of the
traitor. Hardy was sleeping, but the physician
aroused him by shaking his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your presence before the king is desired immediately,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack kept his face averted, for he feared that
Hardy would recognize him in spite of his uniform.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does the king want?” questioned the traitor
of the physician.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do not know, but this officer,” indicating Jack,
“has been sent to conduct you to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right I shall be ready immediately,” said
Hardy.</p>

<p class='c004'>He arose from the bed and slipped into his
clothes, the physician assisting him, for his
wounded arm was wrapped in a sling and gave him
some difficulty. Then, without a word, he followed
Jack from the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, as Jack had sought the hospital he had
noted some of the localities he had passed while
being led along by his own captor, so that he had
a pretty fair idea of the direction in which he
wanted to go. The one thing that he feared was
that Hardy would recognize him before they got
out of the city.</p>

<p class='c004'>He kept his hand on the revolver he had taken
from the Danish officer, whose clothes he had appropriated,
for he was determined that Hardy
would either be taken back to the <i>Sylph</i> alive or
stay in Denmark dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is too dangerous to be allowed to escape scot
free,” the lad told himself. “Besides, Lord Hastings’
last words were to bring him back dead or
alive. I don’t think much of the job, but I’ll do it
if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As they walked along the street, Hardy tried to
strike up a conversation. Jack walked slightly
ahead of him, to prevent him from getting a good
look at his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does the king want with me, do you suppose?”
Hardy asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” replied Jack gruffly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about the other prisoner? Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, he’s safe enough,” was Jack’s answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not very communicative, are you?”
demanded Hardy, stopping suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not very,” replied Jack, stopping also. “But
come along. The king desires your presence immediately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems to me I have heard your voice before,”
said Hardy, resuming his walk. “You are not the
officer who took me to the hospital, are you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then where have we met before?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your imagination is running away with you,”
said Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I know your voice. Hold on, while I get
a look at you,” and he took Jack by the arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>The boy freed his arm with a wrench.</p>

<p class='c004'>“None of that,” he said, in his natural voice.
“You come with me, or I’ll put a hole through
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy stopped suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know you now!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, and you’ll know me a whole lot better if
you don’t do as I tell you,” said Jack quietly.
“Come on, now, move.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Instead of obeying this command. Hardy suddenly
let out a loud cry for help.</p>

<p class='c004'>Instantly Jack whipped his revolver out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One more like that,” he said sternly, “and I’ll
shoot you where you stand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You wouldn’t have the nerve,” was the sneering
response.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t try me,” said Jack quietly. “You are too
dangerous to be running around loose. I would
shoot you with as little compunction as I would a
dog.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy was evidently impressed with Jack’s tone,
for he resumed his walk slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you going to do with me?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take you back aboard the <i>Sylph</i>,” replied the
lad. “And now don’t let me hear another sound
out of you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But the one cry for help which Hardy had made
was enough to cause trouble. For now, from
around the corner came a crowd of men, rushing
up to Jack and his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One word from you,” Jack warned Hardy, “and
I’ll let you have it, no matter what happens to me.
Don’t forget that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By this time the vanguard of the crowd was
upon them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter?” demanded a voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing,” replied Jack calmly. “I thought for
a moment this prisoner was going to get away. He
broke loose and ran down the street, but I caught
him. I called for help because I feared he would
get away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As he spoke he kept his revolver, which he
grasped firmly in his pocket, pointed through the
cloth full at his prisoner. Hardy saw that he was
covered, and he realized that a miss at such close
quarters was practically impossible. So he said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack’s explanation seemed to satisfy the crowd,
for, after following for some distance and asking
a few questions, it gradually drew off.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll never know how close you were to
death,” Jack informed his prisoner. “I thought
once you were going to speak, and my finger was
on the trigger.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I saw it,” replied Hardy quietly. “I am not
entirely a fool.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Remember it, then,” was Jack’s response.</p>

<p class='c004'>For some moments they continued on their way
in silence, and at last Hardy said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Listen here, Templeton! Isn’t there some way
we can fix this thing up? I know what will happen
to me if I am taken back to the <i>Sylph</i>. If this
thing had gone through I would have been a rich
man. I am sure I can explain things satisfactorily
to my superiors. Now you let me go and I’ll see
that you are put in a position that will make you
independent&mdash;that you are made rich.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Silence, you hound!” exclaimed Jack angrily.
“One more remark like that, and I shall be tempted
to shoot you anyhow. I have half a mind to, as
it is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no, you won’t,” was Hardy’s reply. “I
know your kind too well for that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Be careful,” said Jack, in a low tone, “don’t
drive me too far.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The silence that followed was broken a few
moments later by Hardy, who uttered an exclamation.
Jack followed the traitor’s gaze, and broke
into a cold sweat.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the rear came a body of infantry at a run.
Jack drew his revolver and shoved it up against
Hardy’s side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll do a little running ourselves,” he said
quietly. “Hustle, now, and remember I am right
behind you, and that I’ll put a bullet through you
at the first false move.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy, as he himself had said, was no fool. He
realized that Jack meant business, and, in spite of
his wound, that must have pained him greatly, he
started off at top speed, Jack at his heels.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were well beyond the town now, and from
the condition of the road Jack knew that they were
going in the right direction. Also it was growing
dark, and Jack knew that it was necessary for him
to reach the place where he had left the <i>Sylph’s</i>
boat by nightfall.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was positive that his men would still be
there, but he also knew that, in accordance with his
orders, they would not remain a moment after the
time he had set had passed. Consequently, he kept
Hardy going at top speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>From time to time the lad glanced over his head
at his pursuers. He knew that he could outrun
them, but he also knew that Hardy would soon
diminish his speed if possible. Therefore he kept
his revolver ready in his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he had expected, Hardy suddenly began to
slow down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Run,” commanded Jack, “no stopping now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I can’t run any farther,” protested Hardy,
panting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t you?” replied Jack grimly. “Then maybe
this will help you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His revolver spoke, and a bullet whistled by the
traitor’s ear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy leaped forward with renewed energy, and
for a few moments Jack found it hard to keep
pace with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the two came in view of the shore, and
Jack spurred his captive to renewed speed. The
Danish soldiers were still some distance behind,
but now a shot rang out.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No stopping now!” yelled Jack, and, side by
side, the two ran toward the little boat that still
lay in waiting, the crew of which was advancing
to meet them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Quick, men, into the boat,” panted Jack, as they
came together. “We are pursued. We must get
out of range quickly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The men needed no further word. All ran for
the boat at top speed, waded out into the water,
and climbed aboard. Jack, shoving Hardy ahead
of him, was the last over the side.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quickly he stepped to the steering wheel, and a
moment later there was a muffled chug-chug, and
the little craft began to slip through the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a cry of “Halt!” from the shore; but
this went unheeded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Came a volley of rifle shots.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Duck, men,” cried Jack, suiting the action to
the word.</p>

<p class='c004'>One man was a trifle too late, and his arm fell
useless by his side.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurt much?” queried Jack anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not much, sir,” came the reply; “arm’s broken,
I guess. That’s all, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another volley came from the shore, but by this
time the little craft had put such distance between
itself and the shore that accurate shooting was
impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>The speed of the little craft was increased, and
it fairly skimmed over the water.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They will be worried on the <i>Sylph</i>,” Jack explained.
“They are sure to wait for us till morning,
but I want to get back at the earliest possible
moment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardly were these words out of the lad’s mouth
when there was a new commotion on the boat.
Jack’s troubles were not over yet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Prisoner overboard, sir!” came the cry from
one of the sailors.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was true. In the excitement of the moment
Hardy had not been securely bound, and, taking
advantage of a moment when his captors’ backs
were turned, he had slipped quietly over the side,
and was swimming desperately toward the shore.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXI' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <br />ABOARD THE “SYLPH” AGAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Jack sprang quickly to his feet and in a moment
had divested himself of his coat and shoes. Then
he dived headlong into the dark water. The searchlight
of the little craft was playing upon the water,
and Jack could plainly see his prisoner a short distance
ahead.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack was a strong swimmer. At his home in the
little African village he had spent many hours in
the water; and now with great strokes he was overhauling
his quarry.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll get him if I have to chase him all over Denmark,”
the lad told himself grimly, as he swam
along. “I should have watched him more closely.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For at least ten minutes the chase continued.
Then, finding that Jack was bound to catch him,
Hardy turned to face him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, Hardy was no coward, and he was a big
man. On even terms he figured that the lad was
no match for him. He was also an accomplished
swimmer; but he underrated the prowess of the
lad who was pursuing him, and his arm was also
in bad shape.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack came up with his enemy and reached out a
hand to take him by the throat; but, as he did so,
Hardy dove and disappeared from view. A moment
later he came up close to the spot where Jack
had been, and struck out fiercely, thinking to take
the lad by surprise and stun him before his presence
was discovered.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Jack was not to be caught in this manner.
He was far too wary. The moment Hardy sank
from sight, Jack had surmised his ruse and had
shifted his position accordingly. As a result, when
Hardy came up, Jack had him at a disadvantage.
In his haste, however, to get his prisoner back to
the launch, Jack failed to use his advantage and
the blow he aimed at his adversary went wide.
Whereupon Hardy immediately dove again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Spurred to greater mental activity by his failure,
Jack determined upon a bit of strategy. Believing
that Hardy would remain under water this time
as long as possible, in the meantime swimming for
shore, Jack struck out for shore with all his might.
Then, when he thought that Hardy must come to
the surface, the lad made a sudden dive.</p>

<p class='c004'>That Jack’s estimate was a good one was quickly
proven. He had gauged the distance Hardy could
swim with such accuracy that he found himself
swimming directly under the fleeing man. This
was his opportunity, and, rising close to the surface,
Jack seized Hardy by one of his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy kicked out angrily, but to no avail. With
a quick jerk Jack drew the traitor under the water.
Then, rising, he struck out at his adversary and,
taking a deep breath, dived again, grabbing Hardy
by the throat as he went down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beneath the dark water of the ocean the fierce
struggle went on. Jack found his opponent a hard
customer, but soon the lad’s endurance began to tell.
The long breath he had taken just before diving
for the last time was what finally gave him the
victory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy’s struggles became weaker and weaker,
and finally there beneath the water he fell limp in
the lad’s arms. Quickly Jack rose to the surface,
bearing his prisoner with him. Taking a deep, refreshing
breath, he struck out for the little launch,
which had approached to within a short distance of
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Willing hands lifted Hardy over the side and
helped Jack aboard. The prisoner was laid on a
seat, and, after he had been worked over for some
minutes, regained consciousness. This time he was
securely bound.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, I guess you have got me at last,” he said
to Jack, when he had observed his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” was the lad’s reply, “and you may be sure
that you shall not escape again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The little launch was now headed at full speed
for the spot where they had left the <i>Sylph</i> the night
before, and after some hours the patience of those
on board was rewarded. In the distance could be
made out the faint gleam of a searchlight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rapidly the two vessels approached each other,
until the launch at last scraped the side of the scout
cruiser. A moment later Jack and his prisoner
were safe on board.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings’ first thought was for Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you all right?” he demanded anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fit as a fiddle, sir, except that I could go to
sleep right here on the deck.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank approached and grasped his friend’s hand
silently. The pressure of his hand was more significant
than words, and Jack returned the grip
with interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You turn in immediately,” was Lord Hastings’
command to Jack. “I’ll look after the prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d like to see him safely ironed first, sir,” said
Jack. “I had so much trouble getting him, that I
would like to feel sure there is no chance of his
escaping again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have your own way,” laughed Lord Hastings,
and Jack went forward to see the job done.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hardy safely in irons, Jack and Frank returned
to their own quarters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now tell me all about it, old fellow,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll tell you in the morning,” was Jack’s reply,
as, completely exhausted, he fell over in his berth
and into a deep sleep, while from above Frank
heard the signal:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Full speed ahead.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXXII' class='c002'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <br />THE REWARD OF BRAVERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Steadily the <i>Sylph</i> continued her homeward
journey. She passed several vessels, all flying the
British flag, and, in lieu of wireless, her ensigns
many times were dipped in passing salute.</p>

<p class='c004'>At length the little scout cruiser docked in the
exact spot where the boys had gone aboard her the
night they put forth for the North Sea. Upon
Lord Hastings’ request, which was almost in the
nature of a command, Frank and Jack, as well as
Alice Beulow, agreed to go with the British nobleman
to his beautiful and spacious dwelling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My home is yours,” Lord Hastings told them.
“You shall stay there always when in London.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Arrived in London, Lord Hastings’ large automobile
was telephoned for, and several hours later
Frank and Jack found themselves once more installed
in the pretentious quarters where they had
first talked over their plans of going to war.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings, still somewhat feeble because of
his illness, was immediately ordered to bed by his
physician, who prescribed rest and plenty of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will be all right in a week,” was his comforting
verdict.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Frank, Jack and Alice were dining with their
hostess that evening, a huge motor-car drove up to
the house. A footman jumped to the car and
opened the door, and there stepped from within a
tall man with a full beard. The footman bowed
low, and the visitor, alone, made his way up the
steps and into the house. A moment later he was
escorted to Lord Hastings’ chamber.</p>

<p class='c004'>This unceremonious entrance none of the diners
saw, but the two boys were made aware of it a
short time later. A butler entered the dining-room
with word that Lord Hastings desired the presence
of Frank and Jack at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>The two lads followed the servant to Lord Hastings’
chamber, where the visitor sat near the nobleman’s
bedside. Both lads stopped stock still in the
doorway, the utmost surprise manifested on their
faces. They had recognized Lord Hastings’ visitor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lord Hastings raised himself upon one elbow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your Majesty,” he said, “allow me to present
to you, Midshipman Frank Chadwick and Midshipman
John Templeton, to whom Your Majesty, upon
my request, was so good as to grant commissions
only a short time ago. They have proven that
Your Majesty has no braver officers in his entire
navy!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Both boys bowed very low, for Lord Hastings’
visitor was none other than George V., King of
England.</p>

<p class='c004'>The king smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lord Hastings, my cousin and good friend,”
he said, “has spoken of your bravery in glowing
terms. I know that he has not praised you too
highly. Come, sirs, tell me, what do you think of
life on the sea under the Lion of England?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There could be none better, Your Majesty,”
replied Jack.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed there could not, Your Majesty,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the king pleasantly, “I see that you
are fond of the life of midshipmen. What would
you say to accepting, in exchange, lieutenancies in
the Royal Navy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Jack’s surprise was so great that he was unable
to utter a word. His face turned red, and he hung
his head as would a small boy caught in some mischief.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frank was equally as astonished.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I&mdash;we&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c004'>The king laughed outright, and Lord Hastings
smiled faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may make sure, sirs,” continued King
George, “that you shall receive your commissions
as fourth lieutenants in the British navy before another
sun has set! You may go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Here is the fitting place to take leave, for the
time being, of Midshipman Frank Chadwick and
Midshipman John Templeton, of the Royal British
Navy; here is the time to say a brief farewell to
the two gallant lads whose adventures we have
followed through these pages, for the final chapter
in the lives of Frank Chadwick and Jack Templeton,
as British midshipmen, has been written&mdash;though
not the last chapter of their adventures in the greatest
war of all history. The King of England kept
his royal word and on the day following the boys’
brief interview with him they were duly commissioned
Lieutenant Frank Chadwick and Lieutenant
John Templeton.</p>

<p class='c004'>So their further adventures and achievements, in
a different capacity, but in the same cause, and under
the same brave and gallant commander, Lord
Hastings, will be duly chronicled in a second volume,
entitled: “The Boy Allies Under Two Flags;
or, Sweeping the Enemy from the Sea.”</p>

that lives in the wide plains and lofty mountain ranges of the great West.
These tales will delight every lad who loves to read of pleasing adventure in

<p class='c009'>THE BRONCHO RIDER BOYS WITH FUNSTON AT VERA CRUZ; or,
Upholding the Honor of the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p class='c010'>When trouble breaks out between this country and Mexico,

manage to reach the trouble zone, where their real adventures
begin.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE BRONCHO RIDER BOYS AT KEYSTONE RANCH; or,
Three Chums of the Saddle and Lariat.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this story the reader makes the acquaintance of three
devoted chums. The book begins in rapid action, and
there is “something doing” up to the very time you lay
it down.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE BRONCHO RIDER BOYS DOWN IN ARIZONA; or,
A Struggle for the Great Copper Lode.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Broncho Rider Boys find themselves impelled to make

<div class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>The AMY E. BLANCHARD Series</span></div>

<p class='c009'>MISS BLANCHARD has won an enviable reputation
as a writer of short stories for girls. Her books are
thoroughly wholesome in every way and her style is full
of charm. The titles described below will be splendid additions to
every girl’s library. Handsomely bound in cloth, full library size.
Illustrated by L. J. Bridgman. Price, 60 cents per volume, postpaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Glad Lady. A spirited account of a remarkably pleasant
vacation spent in an unfrequented part of northern Spain. This summer,
which promised at the outset to be very quiet, proved to be exactly the
opposite. Event follows event in rapid succession and the story ends with
the culmination of at least two happy romances. The story throughout is
interwoven with vivid descriptions of real places and people of which the
general public knows very little. These add greatly to the reader’s interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wit’s End. Instilled with life, color and individuality, this story of
true love cannot fail to attract and hold to its happy end the reader’s eager
attention. The word pictures are masterly; while the poise of narrative and
description is marvellously preserved.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Journey of Joy. A charming story of the travels and
adventures of two young American girls, and an elderly companion in Europe.
It is not only well told, but the amount of information contained will make it
a very valuable addition to the library of any girl who anticipates making a
similar trip. Their many pleasant experiences end in the culmination of two
happy romances, all told in the happiest vein.</p>

<p class='c013'>Talbot’s Angles. A charming romance of Southern life.
Talbot’s Angles is a beautiful old estate located on the Eastern Shore of
Maryland. The death of the owner and the ensuing legal troubles render it
necessary for our heroine, the present owner, to leave the place which has
been in her family for hundreds of years and endeavor to earn her own living.
Another claimant for the property appearing on the scene complicates matters
still more. The untangling of this mixed-up condition of affairs makes an
extremely interesting story.</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='xlarge'>The Camp Fire Girls Series</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>By HILDEGARD G. FREY. The only series of stories</div>
    <div>for Camp Fire Girls endorsed by the officials of the Camp</div>
    <div>Fire Girls Organization. PRICE, 40 CENTS PER VOLUME</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS IN THE MAINE WOODS; or, The Winnebagos go Camping.</p>

<p class='c010'>This lively Camp Fire group and their Guardian go back to Nature in
camp in the wilds of Maine and pile up more adventures in one summer
than they have had in all their previous vacations put together. Before
the summer is over they have transformed Gladys, the frivolous boarding
school girl, into a genuine Winnebago.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS AT SCHOOL; or, The Wohelo Weavers.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the custom of the Winnebagos to weave the events of their lives
into symbolic bead bands, instead of keeping a diary. All commendatory
doings are worked out in bright colors, but every time the Law
of the Camp Fire is broken it must be recorded in black. How these
seven live wire girls strive to infuse into their school life the spirit of
Work, Health and Love and yet manage to get into more than their
share of mischief, is told in this story.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS AT ONOWAY HOUSE; or, The Magic Garden.</p>

<p class='c010'>Migwan is determined to go to college, and not being strong enough to
work indoors earns the money by raising fruits and vegetables. The
Winnebagos all turn a hand to help the cause along and the “goings-on”
at Onoway House that summer make the foundations shake with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS GO MOTORING; or, Along the Road That Leads the Way.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Winnebagos take a thousand mile auto trip. The “pinching” of
Nyoda, the fire in the country inn, the runaway girl and the dead-earnest
hare and hound chase combine to make these three weeks the
most exciting the Winnebagos have ever experienced.</p>
